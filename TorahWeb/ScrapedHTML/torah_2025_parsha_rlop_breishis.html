<p>There is perhaps no Rashi more famous than the first one in
Chumash: </p>

<p>
<blockquote>
Rebbi Yitzchak said: The Torah
should have commenced with the verse (<i>Shemos</i> 12:2) &#8220;This month
shall be unto you the first of the months&#8221; which is the first commandment
given to Israel. What is the reason, then, that it commences with the account
of Creation? Because of the thought expressed in the text (<i>Tehillim</i>
111:6) &#8220;He declared to His people the strength of His works (i.e. He gave
an account of the work of Creation), in order that He might give them the
heritage of the nations.&#8221; For should the peoples of the world say to
Israel, &#8220;You are robbers, because you took by force the lands of the
seven nations of Canaan&#8221;, Israel may reply to them, &#8220;All the earth
belongs to the Holy One, blessed be He; He created it and gave it to whom He
pleased. When He willed, He gave it to them, and when He willed, He took it
from them and gave it to us&#8221; (<i>Bereishis</i> 1:1).
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>There are many difficulties in understanding this Rashi.
While it is surely important to affirm that <i>Eretz</i> Yisrael belongs to the
Jews, it really is striking that this should be the very beginning of the <i>Chumash</i>.
Secondly, while we believe this to be the case, we have a hard time convincing
the nations of the world that this is so; it is very hard to take the <i>Chumash</i>
with the Rashi, bring it to the nations, and point a finger and say, &#8220;here,
you see it says it belongs to us!&#8221; So, what's the point of it? They will
never be convinced by a verse of <i>Chumash</i> and Rashi, while we don't need
to be convinced. So, who is it written for?</p>

<p>We also need to understand Rashi in a way that this is not
telling us something that we would consider as &#8216;cutting a corner&#8217;;
i.e. that Hashem is doing something that is &#8216;technically correct&#8217;
but not really appropriate. After all, don&#8217;t we all feel that things that
are rightfully people's should be theirs, even if there is legal recourse to
expropriate it? So, what is being stated?</p>

<p>Let us contemplate Rashi&#8217;s question, when he asks that
the Torah should start with &#8216;<i>HaChodesh hazeh lachem</i>&#8217;. This refers
to the fact that the world really consists of two strata. There is a natural
world where there is a process as to how change takes place; it's true
physically, economically, and politically. That natural world is embedded in <i>Bereishis</i>.
It means Hashem created a world that has a natural mechanism and, as such, is &#8220;<i>tov
maod</i> - &nbsp;very good&#8221;, as-is. The world functioning in its natural
process and organization is something Hashem wants.</p>

<p>But there is a second strata on top of that. Hashem instructed
the Jewish people with a set of laws, obligations, and prohibitions that they must
keep. This is a whole new set of behaviors coming from a higher order; they do
not emanate from the realities of our world. The basic Noachide laws, on the
other hand, emanate from and apply to the world around us. This is why they
&#8216;make sense&#8217; to us.</p>

<p>Torah, therefore, being the document of divine commandments,
emanating from beyond our tangible universe, should start with the <i>halachos</i>,
as expressed in &#8216;<i>HaChodesh hazeh lachem</i>&#8217;. The natural world and
its inherent morality doesn&#8217;t need a &#8216;Torah&#8217; to express it.
This is the essence of Rashi&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>Rashi&#8217;s answer is that even in the so-called natural
world, there is one point that does not fit into the natural process; the
natural laws of economics, society, politics, do not govern it, as such. When <i>Chazal</i>
tell us that every country in the world has an angel that is in charge of it
except for <i>Eretz</i> Yisroel (see Rabbeinu Bachya, <i>Devarim</i> 31:15), it
refers to this point. It means that in all the countries in the world the
natural order dominates, while the Divine hand is in the background. <i>Eretz</i>
Yisroel is the exception. Therefore, in the very act of creation wherein Hashem
set up the natural order which includes nations having homelands and
geographical locations that they exist in, an exception was built in. <i>Eretz</i>
Yisroel is just like the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> which was able to accommodate
many more people than its physical area could accommodate (<i>Avos</i> 5:5);
this area was &#8216;extraterritorial&#8217;, i.e. it belonged to a different
order and was not part of physical nature.</p>

<p>This means that Israel&#8217;s lands are not allocated
merely by historical record, but rather by Divine will, as generated by
righteous conduct. A rather famous example of this was when the Kushites came
to live in Israel and continued their quasi-idol worship that they had gotten
used to. Punishment came swiftly, and they desperately sent to the Jews asking
them what's appropriate to worship and not to worship in Israel (<i>Melachim</i>
2, 17:25). <i>Eretz</i> Yisrael is a country that is much more in tune with the
spiritual world, and the Jewish nation's performance is what dictates its hold
on it.</p>

<p>Thus, the first <i>passuk</i> is telling us that Eretz <i>Yisrael</i>
belongs to no one; it belongs to Hashem. It is not, and never was, part of the
natural order. Those who fulfill His will have it, and if they cease to do so, they
lose it. This is true about the nations of the world - when they sinned excessively,
they lost <i>Eretz</i> Yisrael. But it also means that we, <i>Klal</i> Yisroel,
maintain possession of it or lose it based on merit.</p>

<p>In effect, this passage is telling us that Hashem created a
world to run naturally, but the creator leaves His mark in one place. Like an
artist who paints a beautiful painting of some scene or other, and signs his
name in the corner, so too Hashem has &#8216;painted&#8217; a picture of a
natural world, but in a corner his name is &#8217;signed&#8217;. That corner is
<i>Eretz</i> Yisroel. Nations lived there and were evicted from there based on
their performance. This passage is not here to convince the nations of the
world that we're right. It is there to teach us that the reason why we have <i>Eretz</i>
Yisroel is because someone else did not deserve it, and we have it only because
we deserved it.</p>

<p>This places the great burden on us to do what it takes to
keep this land which is, in essence, Hashem&#8217;s land.</p>
