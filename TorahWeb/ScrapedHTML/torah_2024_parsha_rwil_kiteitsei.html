<p align=center style='text-align:center'>I</p>

<P>We are forbidden to marry the descendants of Amon and Moav
forever (<i>Devarim </i>23:4). The Torah explains the reason: "Because
they did not greet you with bread and water on the road when you left Egypt"
(<i>ibid</i>. 23:5). Why such a severe punishment for a sin of omission?</p>

<P>The Ramban explains that Amon and Moav were recipients of
the <i>chessed</i> of Avraham <i>Avinu</i>, who saved their father (Lot) and
mother from the sword and captivity (<i>Bereishis </i>14:16) at the hands of
the four kings (<i>ibid. </i>14:12). Moreover, in the merit of Avraham, Hashem
saved them from the upheaval, i.e. the destruction of Sedom (<i>ibid</i>.
19:29).</p>

<P>The Ramban (<i>Bereishis </i>19:29) adds that Avraham risked
his life to pursue the four kings in order to save Lot. He did so as an act of <i>hakaras
hatov</i>, as Lot had performed an act of <i>chessed</i> for him, accompanying
him to an unknown destination (<i>Bereishis </i>12:4). Lot's descendants,
the nations of Amon and Moav, were likewise dutybound to reciprocate and
perform an act of <i>chessed</i> by providing bread and water to
Avraham's descendants. Failure to do so was a very serious infraction and
resulted in a prohibition for us to marry them.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>II</p>

<P>My close friend and neighbor, Harav Avrohom Ausband <i>zt"l</i>,
<i>Rosh Hayeshiva</i> of Telz-Riverdale, passed away last Thursday. In the
spirit of <i>hakaras hatov</i>, I would like to share some perspectives
particularly relevant to this audience, direct and indirect <i>talmidim </i>and
followers of our great <i>rebbi</i>, Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik <i>zt"l</i>.</p>

<P>Rav Ausband learned for three years with our rebbi's
first cousin and namesake (known as "Rav Berel") in Yerushalayim,
whose <i>hashkafas olam </i>was different from and often even opposed to that
of our rebbi. A lifelong and staunch supporter of his rebbi's Brisker
tradition and the values of his ancestors in Telz and in his birthplace of
Cleveland, Rav Ausband's <i>ahavas Yisrael </i>knew no bounds. For
example: </p>

<P>At a <i>pidyon haben</i>, the <i>Rosh Hayeshiva</i> met Zev
Karasick and heard about our rebbi's famous <i>derasha</i> at Zev's
own <i>pidyon haben</i>. He asked for a recording and expressed his
appreciation in a letter dated Chanukah, 5779, from which I quote: "I
listened to the recording several times, and I find the thoughts expressed
therein fundamental and truly special. May we merit to live up to the ideals
that he expressed by devoting ourselves to doing our part in ensuring the
perpetuation of the <i>mesores haTorah </i>for all generations!"</p>

<P>Rav Ausband's "part" extended well beyond
the <i>talmidim </i>of his yeshiva in Riverdale. In January 2017, he met a
group of YU students, led by me and Rav Etan Schnall, during our <i>bein
hasemesterim </i>break. In his <a
href="https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/755337/Ki-Heim-Chayeinu-V'Oreich-Yameinu">remarks</a>,
he quoted the Chafetz Chaim, who valued every moment of life as an opportunity
to serve Hashem. Our <i>talmidim </i>were very impressed by his personal
interest in each one, as well as by the thundering responses at the Mincha <i>minyan</i>
in his yeshiva. A picture of the <i>Rosh Hayeshiva</i> with the guest <i>talmidim</i>
adorned the cover page of the next Telz yeshiva newsletter.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>III</p>

<P>The Riverdale community in general, and my shul, The Young
Israel of Riverdale, in particular, owe a debt of <i>hakaras hatov</i> to the <i>Rosh
Hayeshiva zt"l</i>. He had very close relationships with many YU alumni
and was not deterred at all by the type or size of their yarmulka. He gave a
regular <i>shiur</i> for doctors, most of whom learned in YU. He respected
their brilliance, and they were in awe of his.</p>

<P>About twenty years ago, Rav Ausband helped organize a <i>kollel</i>,
for which he assumed responsibility ever since. <i>Kollel</i> members have
established <i>chavrusa</i>s and <i>shiurim</i>, enhancing Torah learning in
our <i>shul</i>, and the <i>kollel</i> wives, by deed and example, have had a
very positive impact.</p>

<P>About five years ago, the <i>Rosh Hayeshiva</i> arranged an
hour-long morning <i>chabura </i>in our <i>shul</i>. At present, thirty
to forty <i>baalabatim </i>learn <i>b'chavrusa </i>from 6-7 A.M. every
weekday, followed by Shacharis. Rav Ausband was extremely proud of this
initiative, which he correctly described as "transformative," and
he constantly extolled the dedication of the "<i>kollel boker</i>
wives."</p>

<P>All this began when the yeshiva moved to Riverdale forty
years ago this week. At his <i>levayah</i>, I recounted his very first <i>derashah
</i>in Riverdale, which took place at a <i>siyum Mishnayos </i>in our shul on <i>motza'ei</i>
Shabbos, 7 Adar II, 1984.</p>

<P>The Gemara (<i>Megillah </i>13b) tells us that when Haman's
lot fell on Adar (<i>Esther </i>3:7), he was overjoyed, as it was the month in
which Moshe died. But he didn't know that while Moshe died on the seventh
of Adar, he was also born on the seventh of Adar. What does this mean?</p>

<P>The Maharal (<i>Ohr Chadash </i>op. cit.) explains that
Moshe represented all of <i>Am</i> Yisrael. His passing in the twelfth and
final month of the year indicated the end of <i>Am</i> Yisrael, Haman's
very goal. However, Moshe's birth on the seventh of Adar shows that his
passing on that same date is not an end, but a completion. When the beginning
and end join together, there is a completion, as in a round ball. This is what
Moshe meant when he said, "<i>Mal'u yamai</i> - my days are
complete" (<i>Sotah </i>13b; see <i>Bereishis </i>29:21). Hashem
completes the years of <i>tzaddikim </i>from day to day and month to month (see
<i>Shemos </i>23:26). When there is a completion, there can be no end.</p>

<P>Moshe led <i>Am</i> Yisrael in the desert for forty years.
So too, Rav Ausband led the yeshiva in Riverdale for exactly forty years. His
passing is not an end, but a completion.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>IV</p>

<P>Finally, a personal <i>hakaras hatov</i>. The Ausband family
moved into an apartment down the hall from ours just before Pesach in 1984. We
were close neighbors, in both senses, for forty years. The positive impression
the <i>Rosh Hayeshiva</i> and his family made on ours is incalculable. My
children admired him, learned from him, and were transformed and elevated by his
direct and indirect influence. We shared in each other's simchas and
losses throughout the years.</p>

<P>The very last wedding the <i>Rosh Hayeshiva</i> attended
- less than three days before his passing - was that of our
grandson. He danced with three generations of Willigs with characteristic
gusto. Those moments, captured on video, deepen both our sense of appreciation
and our sense of loss.</p>

<P>The next day, my son Moshe had a lengthy conversation with
Rav Ausband. His final sentence was, "Your father wrote in his <i>Haggadah</i>,
in describing our relationship, 'The land was tranquil for forty
years' (<i>Shoftim </i>5:31)." We lived - both personally and
communally - in peace and harmony for forty years. His passing leaves a
gaping hole in our family, community, and the entire <i>olam hatorah</i>.</p>

<P>Much, much more can be added to this brief tribute to a
great man. As <i>hakaras hatov</i>, he would certainly want us to repay his
Torah and <i>chessed</i> by strengthening our own. May his unique and
unforgettable personality inspire us to serve Hashem, as he did, with all our
might.</p>
