<p align=center style='text-align:center;'>I</span></p>

<P>Life in the diaspora
poses various conundrums, amongst them political involvement/activism. We aim <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1505;"&#1491;</span> to focus on one representative, specific
question. To what degree, if any, should we be involved in presidential
politics?</p>

<P>As citizens we have a
self-interest in and responsibility for society<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title="">[2]</a>. On both accounts,
our right to vote translates into a responsibility to do so. And, in fact, that
was the position of my grandfather, Rav Soloveitchik <i>ztllh"h</i>, as
well as Rav Moshe Feinstein <i>ztllh"h</i> (amongst others).</p>

<P>Our relationship to and standing within the diaspora is dialectical. Externally, from a secular,
societal perspective we should be recognized and appreciated as full-fledged
citizens. But, internally, from a Torah perspective, in our own eyes, we are
always strangers.</p>

<P>"'He
sojourned there' - this teaches us that our patriarch Ya'akov intended
only to sojourn, not settle, [in Egypt]." I.e., this teaches for all
generations how Jews must conduct themselves in each and every exile, that they
should know that they have not descended to the diaspora to settle, rather to
sojourn until the redemption (literally, end of days), and they should view
themselves as non-citizens. (<i>Meshech Chochmah</i>, <i>Vayikra</i> 26:44)</p>



<P>Civic loyalty to and
responsibility for our country of residence notwithstanding, we recognize that
the land outside of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is not ours. Our existential mindset
and consciousness are that of an uprooted, displaced refugee whose real and
rightful place is in the land of Israel.</p>

<P>We must also be
constantly, acutely aware of the dangerous reality of anti-semitism, both
latent and active. While the world is blessed with the devout of the nations (<span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;
&#1488;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;</span>), it is also plagued by the
scourge of anti-semites. We must not be ignorantly lulled into a naive, false
sense of security based upon our own very limited, mostly congenial, personal
experience (for which we are very grateful to the United States). Instead we
must be wisely, cautiously realistic, based upon our extensive, bloody,
national-historical experience. Anti-semitism is very real, and easily ignited
or excited.</p>

<P>[As an aside, our
generation, at times, lacks adequate historical consciousness. But that is a
subject for another time.]</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;'>II</p>

<P>How did all this translate this year in terms of politicking?</p>

<P>Election campaigns are often (as of late, almost always) adversarial and divisive, never more so
than this year. To the best of my knowledge, never before in our lifetimes has
there been a [very well-founded] concern for violence in the aftermath of an election.
In some respects, the country resembles a tinderbox.</p>

<P>Nothing could be more clear: in general, our conspicuously campaigning as Jews for any candidate is
egregiously wrong and dangerous; how much more so this year given the volatile divisiveness
of the campaign; how much more so when such politicking is carried out
aggressively, even belligerently. It is wrong because a sojourner should not
insert himself into political controversy and adversarialism, especially when
marked by such volatility and vitriol. It is dangerous because <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1512;"&#1500;</span> there are dangerous anti-semites on both sides who are easily
provoked. Inevitably one side loses, potentially leaving a small segment of its
supporters explosively angry. In such a climate it is highly irresponsible to
act so conspicuously and provocatively. We are resilient and not easily
intimidated; but we are also wise and prudently cautious.</p>

<P>Simply (if a tad too colloquially) put, a visitor should not interfere in a domestic, political
fight. And a potential target of anti-semitism should not be seen as seeking to
influence the outcome of a highly charged, volatile campaign. His lack of
realism in that effort does not diminish the potential danger.</p>

<P>The practical applications are not all behind us. Pre-election campaigning has concluded; but
who knows what post-election protests await? It is categorically forbidden and
utterly reckless for any Jew to participate in such protests should they
materialize.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;'>III</p>

<P>Some supplementary perspectives on politicking. It is incongruous, and thus wrong, to campaign as
Jews for John Doe. Whereas religious-moral values can and should determine how
we vote, ultimately voting is a political act. This is so because of the need
to politically assess which candidate will best advance those values. Given the
variability and individuality of perception and judgment<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>, it
is commonplace that people with the same vision nonetheless disagree in their
political assessments of competing candidates. Thus, voting remains very much a
political act. And for this reason it is entirely incongruous, and thus wrong,
for us to identify ourselves as Jews for John Doe.<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>

<P>[I believe that this is why my grandfather steadfastly refused to give political endorsements. When
we venture outside the realm of Torah and yet speak in her name, we politicize Torah. This can never be countenanced.]</p>

<P>Moreover, when we publicly, vociferously identify as Jews for John Doe we overstep our
boundaries. In so doing, willy-nilly we indicate that Jewishness is the
determining, driving force. Yet we are not qualified nor have we been
authorized to speak on behalf of Judaism.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;'>IV</p>

<P>Our sojourner status and vulnerability preclude partisan political activity such as presidential
electioneering which, by its very nature, is antagonistic and confrontational.
Advocacy, outside of an election campaign, however, can greatly differ. Let us
explain and illustrate by focusing on a particular historical precedent: the
marches and protests on behalf of Soviet Jewry.</p>

<P>There was a definite difference of opinion regarding the practical advisability and effectiveness of
such activism. The activism did not, however, conflict with the principles
outlined above. The reason being that Soviet Jewry advocacy did not align
itself with a particular political party. This enabled the Soviet Jewry
movement to non-antagonistically, by means of moral suasion, promote its vital,
noble cause. While political actions and measures on behalf of Soviet Jewry
were clearly sought, the advocacy was unequivocally moral and its United States
context non-antagonistic. By contrast, presidential campaigning even when
religiously-morally motivated, is inescapably political and thus
confrontational. Therein lie the differences.</p>

<P><i>Rabbonim</i> who publicly opposed the Vietnam war operated with a similar
(overlapping but not identical) calculus. They felt that their actions were not
only justified but warranted because the anti-war position for all its
political implications was fundamentally moral (and thus fundamentally
apolitical); in that vein a broad spectrum of Americans coalesced around it. By
contrast, presidential campaigning, for all its religious-moral motivation, is
fundamentally political.</p>

<P>It goes without saying that the "Rabbi's March" on Washington during World
War II in an attempt to halt genocide was an <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1506;&#1514;
&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1493;&#1514;</span> (a time for emergency measures) which requires no analysis or
further explanation. The recent election in England, featuring the dangerous,
overt anti-semitism of the [then] Labour party provided another unquestionable
instance of <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1506;&#1514;
&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1493;&#1514;</span>, albeit of an entirely different magnitude.</p>

<P>In present times, the annual Israel day parade apolitically, non-confrontationally advocates by
joyfully celebrating the US-Israel alliance which has traditionally enjoyed
broad, bi-partisan support.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center;'>V</p>

<P>It is imperative that we carefully assess every instance of political involvement or activism in light of the above principles and criteria.</p>
