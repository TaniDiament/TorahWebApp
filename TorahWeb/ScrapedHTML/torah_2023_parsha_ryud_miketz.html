<!--text-->

<P>In <i>Parshas Miketz</i> (41:51) we are taught that Yosef
called the name of his firstborn Menashe because "Hashem has made me
forget all my hardships and all my father's household." The first
explanation for the name is most understandable. Yosef, who encountered many
challenging episodes, trials, and tribulations, gives thanks to Hashem for
enabling him to forget and create a family after all his setbacks. The second
reason, however, is most difficult to understand. What does it mean that Yosef
gives thanks to Hashem for enabling him to forget his father's home? It is
clear from the way our sages understand the text that Yosef never forgot his
father, his household, and his roots.</p>

<P>In <i>Parshas Vayeishev</i> (39:11), when Yosef overcomes
his natural temptation and flees from the advances of his master's wife, Rashi
cites the Medrash Tanchuma which states that it was the vision of his father,
Yaakov, that enabled Yosef to avoid sin. This shows that Yaakov still played a
major role in his life. Similarly, in <i>Parshas Vayigash</i> (45:27), we are
taught that when "Yaakov sees the <i>agalos </i>(wagons) that Yosef has
sent to transport him to Egypt, the spirit of Yaakov was revived." The
Rabbis understand that the wagons represent either the six covered wagons that
the twelve princes of Israel donated to transport the <i>Mishkan</i>, as found
in <i>Bamidbar</i> (6:3), or to remind Yaakov of the last Torah topic that they
studied together, namely the laws of <i>eglah arufah</i>, the incident of a
murdered body found in Israel. Regardless, it shows that Yosef did not forget
the Torah he learned in Yaakov's house, even after twenty-two years of
separation. So, how are we to understand the name Menashe to mean that Hashem
helped Yosef forget his father's home?</p>

<P>I'd like to share an explanation given by Reb Simcha Zisel
Brody <i>zt"l</i>, Rosh Yeshiva Yeshivas Chevron. He cites the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a), which teaches that when Reb Zeira, who studied in
Babylonia, decided to move and study in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> under Reb
Yochanan, he fasted one hundred times to "forget" the Torah of Bavel,
thereby enabling him to more easily absorb the Torah of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
He did not literally forget the Babylonian Talmud, rather he was eager to
absorb the new approach to <i>talmud</i> Torah in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Unlike
the Babylonian Talmud, which is replete with arguments between the Rabbis, the
Jerusalem Talmud is significantly more devoid of friction between the scholars
and more straightforward in the implementation and explanation of Jewish law.
Reb Zeira demonstrated the ability to adapt from one community to another.</p>

<P>At the end of <i>Parshas Toldos</i> (28:2), Yitzchak
instructs Yaakov to leave the land of Israel and marry one of his cousins, the
daughters of his uncle Lavan. Rashi on the closing verse in <i>Toldos</i>
provides an extensive commentary that proves that between Yaakov's leaving home
and arriving at his uncle's home, there was a fourteen-year gap. The Rabbis
attribute these fourteen years to Yaakov's having gone to study Torah at the
Yeshiva of Shem and Aver. Why was this detour necessary? Reb Yaakov Kaminetzky <i>zt"l</i>
(in <i>Emes L'Yaakov</i>) teaches that while Yaakov studied much Torah with his
father, that was Torah appropriate for the Land of Israel. Now that Yaakov was
going to <i>chutz la'aretz</i>, he needed to study Torah that could be
maintained in different surroundings and challenges - the Torah of <i>galus</i>.
It is this knowledge that our Rabbis teach us that Yaakov taught his son Yosef.
Indeed, this is why Yosef calls his son Menashe as he was thanking Hashem for
helping him "forget" the manner of observance in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>
and helping him adapt to his new challenges and surroundings.</p>

<P>As Yosef adapted and forgot his previous lifestyle, it
behooves us to unfortunately take a new look and reexamine what has been, for
many, a normative behavioral pattern for almost a hundred years. I am referring
to the mode whereby many Jewish, and even Torah-observant, families enroll
their college-aged students in universities after high school. There, they
receive higher education that enables them to advance both individually and to
enrich society. The presence of nearby Chabad, Hillel, and <i>shiurim</i> on
many campuses has helped sustain and maintain a positive Jewish identification
for numerous Jewish students throughout the country.</p>

<P>Since October 7th, there has been an immediate unleashing of
anti-Israel and anti-Semitic pronouncements throughout much of the civilized
world, especially on college campuses. What perhaps was always there but
beneath the surface has now come out of the woodwork, making Jewish students
who have loyalty and devotion to Israel feel either threatened or uncomfortable
in their academic surroundings. Even worse, a great percentage of Jewish
students who are themselves uneducated about the history of Israel, its value
for human life, and its humanitarian gestures of urging civilians to leave Gaza
and avoid being caught up in the military conflict, are subject to propaganda
found both unfortunately in the classroom and in student activities on campus.</p>

<P>We have to learn from Yosef that what worked before might
not work in the future. Jewish parents must come to realize the high cost of
free speech. They must be informed that there are valid Jewish alternatives to
the present challenging secular college campuses, where, in the name of free
speech, a great disconnect can be created between our promising Jewish student
population and our proud Jewish heritage. What is at stake on secular college
campuses today is nothing less than the essence of our identity as the People
of the Book, risking the loss of a generation's connection to the profound and
timeless wisdom that our sacred texts and traditions offer.</p>
