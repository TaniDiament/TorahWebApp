<p align="center" style="text-align: center;">I.</p>

<p>"The valley was filled with many very dry bones"
(Yechezkel 37:1,2. <i>haftorah</i> of Shabbos Chol HaMoed Pesach). "Hashem
said to me 'These bones [represent] all of <i>Bais</i> Yisrael. They say,
'Our bones are dried out, and our hope is lost (<i>avda tikvaseinu</i>)'"
(37:11). "Tell them 'I will put my spirit into you, and you will
come to life, and I will place you on your soil'" (37:14). The
eternal message in these <i>pesukim</i> refers to the final resurrection of the
dead, which will take place in Nissan (<i>Mishna Berurah</i> 490:14). The
reality of "many very dry bones" in Auschwitz is seared in the
collective memory of "all of <i>Bais</i> Yisrael". The miraculous
rebirth of <i>Am</i> Yisrael on its soil just three years later proved that,
contrary to our saying "our bones are dried out and our hope is
lost", <i>od lo avda tikvaseinu</i> - our hope is not lost at all.</p>

<p>Sadly, our enemies continue to try to destroy us.
Tragically, on Simchas Torah, they reached our soil and killed hundreds of
innocent civilians, violating their bodies, before and after killing them, and
burning many beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Haman planned, "<i>lehashmid, laharog
u'l'abed es kol haYehudim</i> - to destroy, kill and eliminate all
the Jews" (Esther 3:13). The Vilna Ga'on teaches that Amalek tries
to defile us (see Rashi, <i>Devarim</i> 25:18), as in <i>shmad</i> - spiritual
destruction, kill us, and even burn our bodies. The Nazis, who burned our
bodies in crematoria, were the Amalek of the 20th century, and Hamas is the
Amalek of the 21st century.</p>

<p>Haman, Hitler and Hamas all vow to kill us all (Esther 9:24,
see Ramban <i>Megillah</i> 2a). The Rav <i>zt"l</i> (whose 31st <i>yohrtzeit</i>
is on <i>erev</i> Shabbos) quoted that his father Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik <i>zt"l</i>
taught that any nation that wants to kill all the Jews is, by definition,
Amalek, irrespective of its genealogical roots. The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Melachim</i>
5:4-5) states that we can no longer identify the seven nations that we must
eliminate because Sancheirev intermingled all the nations (as described in the <i>mishna</i>,
<i>Yadayim</i> 4:4), but this does not apply to Amalek, because any nation that
vows to destroy us is considered by halacha to be Amalek (<i>Kol Dodi Dofek</i>,
footnote #23). For this reason, the Rav initially opposed German reparations (<i>Nefesh
Harav</i> p. 87).</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;">II.</p>

<p>Last week, (8 Nissan), I visited <i>Machane Shura</i>, the
headquarters of the Chief Rabbinate of <i>Tzahal</i>, accompanied by 5 members
of my immediate family. Rav Binyamin Zimmerman, a member of the Rabbinate of
the Israeli Army who arranged the visit, introduced us to the head of the <i>halacha</i>
department, Harav Avihud Shwartz. His presentation of the complex questions
dealt with by the department was scintillating. He demonstrated a depth of
knowledge and a finely tuned approach to the halachic system worthy of a <i>posek</i>
well beyond his approximately forty years. His reverence for <i>mori v'rabi
</i>Harav Aharon Lichtenstein <i>zt"l</i>, with whom he learned for nine years,
was remarkable. The combination of broad Talmudic scholarship, halachic mastery
and personal sensitivity which permeated Harav Schwartz's brilliant and
lengthy <i>shiur</i> reflected his <i>rebbi</i>'s unforgettable persona,
and is a tribute to both <i>rebbi</i> and <i>talmid</i>.</p>

<p>If Harav Schwartz dazzled our minds, the next presenter, Rav
Menachem Wechsler, penetrated our hearts. A twenty-seven-year veteran of the army
<i>chevra kadisha</i>, his vast experience in the excruciating holy work of
honoring the remains of fallen Israeli soldiers has done nothing to dim the emotional
aspect of his virtuous personality and powerful presentation. Speaking in the
spacious new (two-year-old) facility, he showed us the rooms used for <i>tahara</i>,
cleaning the body. One was designated for female soldiers, another had a <i>mikva</i>.</p>

<p>On October 7, Simchas Torah, hundreds of bodies overwhelmed
the facility. Most martyrs were civilians and thus <i>Tzahal</i> did not have the
identifying data that they record for all soldiers. There was no record of who
was missing, and no knowledge of who was taken hostage. Many bodies were burned
beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Rav Wechsler's heart-rending description of the heroic
non-stop work of identifying the bodies, often using DNA, was overwhelming and
unforgettable. The professionalism, including a trip to Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware, which is the top DNA lab in the world, matched the idealism of the
devoted male and female <i>chevra kadisha</i>, in establishing certain
identity, legally and halachically, as quickly as possible. Rav
Wechsler's final speech in the "<i>cheder preida</i>", the
room where families of the victims bade them farewell, was emotionally
overpowering. He called the room "<i>Kodesh Kodashim</i>", the Holy
of Holies, and read a letter written by a bereaved father, filled with faith
and pathos.</p>

<p>Rav Zimmerman then took us to a room filled with <i>sifrei</i>
Torah from all parts of the world, donated to fulfill the needs of the soldiers
throughout <i>Eretz</i> Yisrael and in Gaza. Even the ones unfit for use
represent the eternity of our people, despite the constant efforts to destroy
us. According to Rav Yaakov Emden (<i>Sulam Beis El</i>, p. 8), the unique
historical phenomenon of a nation that has outlived all of the powerful empires
that sought to destroy it and has survived with the Torah intact, is a greater
miracle that those that Hashem performed for our ancestors in Mitzrayim.</p>

<p align="center" style="text-align: center;">III.</p>

<p>On <i>motzaei</i> Shabbos (6 Nissan), Hashem again performed
a miracle for His people on His soil. Over three hundred missiles, rockets and
drones were launched by Iran in an unprecedented attack on Israel. Not one Jew
was harmed, a statistical impossibility notwithstanding the Iron Dome and other
devices.</p>

<p>We are dutybound to thank and praise Hashem for the
incredible miracle. More than one rabbi, citing the Netziv (<i>Sheilta</i>
26:1), opined that there was a Torah commandment to recite Hallel on the day of
the miracle.</p>

<p>One of the many miracles that took place on the night of
Pesach is described in the Haggadah, citing the opening <i>passuk</i> of the <i>haftorah</i>
of the eighth day of Pesach (Yeshaya 10:32), "Today he (Sancheirev) will
stand in Nov." His huge army encamped there overnight, ready to enter and
destroy Yerushalayim the next day. Hashem had said that the king of Ashur will
not enter the city (Melachim 2, 19:32), and indeed, on that Pesach night,
Hashem killed one hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrian soldiers.</p>

<p>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 94a) criticizes
Chizkiyahu for not reciting <i>shira</i> immediately upon the miracle of the
soldiers' death. The <i>Emek B'racha</i> (<i>Hallel al HaNes</i> p.
124,125), citing Rav Chaim of Brisk, says that Tehillim (13:6) teaches us:
"I trust in Your kindness, my heart will exult in Your salvation. I will
sing to Hashem because He saved me". Even one who is one hundred percent
sure that Hashem will save him must sing to Hashem only after the miracle has
occurred.</p>

<p>The <i>medrash</i> (<i>Shir Hashirim Raba</i> 4:19) gives
Chizkiyahu's excuse, citing the penultimate <i>passuk</i> of the same <i>haftorah</i>
(Yeshayahu 12:5), "Hashem's miracles are known throughout the
world." He therefore thought that there was no need for a new <i>shira</i>.
This is incorrect, however, and prevented Chizkiyahu from becoming the <i>mashiach</i>.
We dare not repeat this mistake; we must thank Hashem for the miracle we experienced.</p>

<p>The <i>Medrash Raba</i> (<i>Shemos</i> 18:5) recounts that
on that fateful night of Pesach, while surrounded by enemy forces and impending
doom, Chizkiyahu recited Hallel, while the people were frightened. The Yefe
To'ar says that they were unaware of Yeshayahu's prophecy that
Sancheirev would not reach the city. In the morning, they arose to recite the <i>Shema</i>
and <i>daven Shachris k'vasikin</i> (Etz Yosef). The Eshed Hanechalim
says that this demonstrates the greatness of the <i>bitachon</i> of Chizkiyahu.
Their Hallel is described by Yeshayahu (30:29), "The song will be yours
like the night of the holiday's consecration." The Ra'avad (<i>Hilchos</i>
<i>Chanukah</i> 3:6) states that this is the source for our obligation to
recite Hallel.</p>

<p>Presumably, Chizkiyahu's tremendous faith diminished
his realization of the obligation to recite Hallel immediately. He expected all
along to be saved. Similarly, <i>Am</i> Yisrael in <i>Eretz</i> Yisrael is
"<i>melumad b'nissim</i>", accustomed to miracles. However, we
must not allow ourselves, in Israel or in the diaspora, to fail to recognize the
great miracle that occured. We must, on Pesach, thank and sing to Hashem for
it.</p>

<p>The Malbim (<i>Yeshayahu</i> 30:29) writes that as the <i>simcha</i>
of Yisrael increased when they recited Hallel and thanked Hashem when they
offered the <i>korban</i> Pesach, the destruction of the encampment of Ashur
increased correspondingly.</p>

<p>In Tehillim (118:14,15) the Malbim interprets the phrase, "<i>kol
rena v'yeshua</i>" to mean when the rejoicing of Hallel began, the
sound of salvation came; as they began to sing and to thank Hashem, so came the
salvation. We hope and pray that our Hallel will save us from our foes.</p>

<p>We approach Pesach, still horrified by the pogrom of <i>Simchas</i>
Torah, still praying for the safe return of the hostages, still heartbroken
after all the suffering of the last seven months since the last <i>chag</i>.
Yet, at the same time, we thank Hashem for saving us from the much worse fate
that our enemies planned, and for the amazing faith of <i>Am</i> Yisrael.</p>

<p>The <i>haftorahs</i> of Shabbos Chol Hamoed and <i>acharon
shel</i> Pesach teach us that the dry bones of Yechezkel's prophecy will
come to life on our soil. The partial fulfillment of that prophecy via the
remnants of Auschwitz establishing a State which belies the doomsday predictions
of then and now that <i>avda tikvaseinu</i> and that sings <i>od lo avda
tikvaseinu</i>, has occurred. We fervently pray and await the fulfillment of
the prophecy of Yeshayahu (11:1-16), i.e. the arrival of Mashiach, a descendant
of David and Yishai, which will usher in an era of peace. He will gather in our
dispersed people, and the world will be filled with the knowledge of Hashem.
May it happen speedily in our days.</p>
