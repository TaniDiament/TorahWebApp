<p align=center style='text-align:center'>I</p>

<p>From
when Adar enters, we increase joy (<i>Ta'anis</i> 29a). Is this true for
the first Adar in a leap year as well? The <i>Mishna</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 6b)
states that there is no difference between the first and second Adar except
reading the <i>Megillah</i> and gifts for the poor. This implies that the
increased joy applies to both Adars. Furthermore, R' Levi Yitzchak of
Berdichev (Kedushas Levi<i>, Parshas Ki Sisa, s.v. ta'am</i>) writes that
it is known that the twelve months correspond to the twelve tribes (see Tur, <i>Orach
Chaim</i> 417). The <i>mazal</i> of Adar is <i>dagim</i>, fish (Esther Rabba
7:11), which corresponds to Yosef who is compared to fish that the evil eye
does not harm. Rashi (<i>Bereishis</i> 49:22), cites the <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Berachos</i>
20a) that the evil eye does not affect Yosef or his descendants. When Yaakov
blessed Menashe and Efrayim he said (48:16), "may they reproduce
abundantly like fish", over which the evil eye has no effect, presumably
because they are hidden underwater. [See <i>Kedushas Levi, Tetzave, s.v. oh</i>.]
The Kedushas Levi concludes: Yosef fathered two tribes, Menashe and Efrayim,
and therefore, there are two Adars [perhaps this is why the <i>mazal</i> is <i>dagim</i>,
plural, not <i>dag</i>, singular like the <i>mazalos</i> all the other months] both
of which have the <i>mazal</i> of <i>dagim</i> and increased joy (<i>Nitei
Gavriel</i>, Purim 11:1, fn 2). The Chosam Sofer (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 163)
agrees that the first Adar has increased joy as well.</p>

<p>He
cites Rashi (<i>Ta'anis</i> 29a) on, "when Adar enters" who
says, "Purim and Pesach were days of miracles for Yisrael." Rav
Yaakov Emden (She'elas Yaavetz II:88) asks, why does Rashi include
Pesach? It must be to teach us that increased joy applies <u>only</u> to the
Adar that is close to Pesach, namely Adar II in a leap year.</p>

<p>Indeed,
in determining which Adar the <i>Megillah</i> should be read in, the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Megillah</i> 6b) rules that it is read in the Adar which is adjacent to
Nisan, namely Adar II. The <i>Gemara</i> explains the reason for this is that it
is preferred to "juxtapose redemption to redemption", which Rashi explains
to mean juxtapose Purim to Pesach.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>II</p>

<P>A
deeper understanding of Rashi's inclusion of Pesach can refute the proof
of Rav Yaakov Emden. There are two types of miracles, hidden and supernatural.
Purim commemorates a hidden miracle in which no laws of nature were broken,
while Pesach celebrates a series of supernatural miracles. Joy increases when
we recognize Divine Providence in the hidden miracles as well, and seeing Divine
Providence everywhere equally applies to Adar. Rashi mentioned Pesach to equate
the two types of miracles as sources for increased joy.</p>

<p>The Ramban (<i>Shemos</i> 13:16) writes:
<blockquote>From
the great and famous miracles (i.e. the supernatural ones of the Exodus), a
person acknowledges the hidden miracles which are the foundation of the entire
Torah. A person has no portion in the Torah of Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> unless he
believes that all our things and happenings are all miracles, not natural and
the [unguided] custom of the world, whether communal or personal.
</blockquote></p>

<p>The
realization that nothing in our lives is left to chance yields the greatest
possible joy. The connection of Purim to Pesach does not limit joy to Adar II,
rather it explains the joy of both Adars. Adar II celebrates the hidden
miracles of the <i>Megillah</i>, while Adar I goes further and acknowledges
everyday events as reflections of Divine Providence. As the Mishna teaches, the
two Adars are identical except for the <i>Megillah</i> and the gifts for the
poor, which focus exclusively on the hidden miracles of Purim.</p>

<p>The
connection to the <i>mazal</i> of <i>dagim</i> and to Yosef who is not subject
to the evil eye may be explained as follows: fish are hidden from the human eye
as Adar commemorates hidden miracles. Yosef merited the blessing of protection
from the evil eye when he hid his mother Rachel from Esav's wanton gaze (<i>Bereishis</i>
33:7, Rashi there and 49:22).</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>III</p>

<P>What
about Purim <i>Katan</i>, 14 Adar I? In the final section of <i>Orach Chaim</i>
(697:1), the Rama states that some say that one is obligated to increase
"<i>mishteh v'simcha</i>" (see Esther 9:22) on the 14th of
Adar I. This is not our custom, but one should increase his <i>se'uda</i>
a bit to satisfy the strict view; "a good-hearted person is always
feasting - <i>mishteh tamid</i>" (Mishlei 15:15).</p>

<p>The
Taz (697:2) invokes the aforementioned Mishna (<i>Megillah</i> 6b) in equating
the two Adars regarding feasting on the 14th of Adar I, and endorses the
Rama's conclusion of "<i>mishteh tamid</i>." The Birkas Yosef
(2) cited in the Shaarei Teshuva (2) lauds the Rama's wisdom in concluding
<i>Orach Chaim</i> similar to how he opened it: he began (1:1) "I have
set Hashem before me always - <i>tamid</i>" (Tehilim 16:8), and ended with
"<i>mishteh tamid</i>", thus two "<i>temidim</i>".</p>

<p>The
<i>passuk</i> in Mishlei (15:15) begins: "All the days of a poor person
are bad." The Vilna Ga'on cites the <i>Mishna</i> (<i>Avos</i>
4:11) "who is rich? One who is happy with his potion." If so, a
poor person is one who has a greedy soul. All his days are bad, because he can
never attain all that he desires. By contrast, one who is satisfied with what
he has, his heart is always as happy as one who has a <i>mishteh</i> in his
house. A person at a feast is very happy when he is a <i>shasuy yayin</i>,
intoxicated by fulfilling <i>mishteh</i> literally with excessive wine. But his
happiness is temporary and ends when the influence of alcohol subsides. The happiness
of one who has a good heart is always as great as the momentary happiness of
one who is intoxicated.</p>

<p>This
interpretation leads to an opposite understanding of the Rama's
conclusion. One who has a good heart has no need to drink wine. He is always
happy, without artificial stimulation. This level of constant joy described in 697:1
reflects the opening of the Rama in 1:1. One who constantly sets Hashem before
him realizes that his portion comes from Hashem and is satisfied with it. He
thereby attains constant joy, equivalent to the temporary high of alcohol,
without drinking.</p>

<p>In
this way, the heightened joy of Purim Katan is based upon the joy of the entire
month. Adar teaches that the hidden miracles of Purim are from Hashem just as the
supernatural ones of Pesach are. The extension of the Ramban to everyday
occurrences governed by Divine Providence is a source of constant joy. This
makes drinking on Purim <i>Katan</i> superfluous.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>IV</p>

<p><i>Am</i>
<i>Yisrael</i> is entering Adar reeling from the crisis in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
The realization that these tragic events are also manifestations of Divine
Providence must lead us to <i>teshuva</i> which will bring the crisis to an end
(Rambam, <i>Hilchos Ta'aniyos</i> 1:1). Even during this crisis, we
increase joy in Adar by recognizing that all of our experiences, individual and
especially communal, are miracles governed by Divine Providence, as the Ramban
emphasizes.</p>

<p>"My
anger will flare on that day, I will forsake them and conceal My face from them
and they will become prey" (<i>Devarim</i> 31:17). The otherwise
inexplicable events of October 7th, when over a thousand of our brothers and
sisters became prey of vicious invaders, can only be a result of Hashem's
decree. The <i>passuk</i> continues: "many evils and distresses (<i>tzaros</i>)
will afflict [<i>Am Yisroel</i>]. They will say on that day, 'Because
Hashem is not in our midst these evils have afflicted me.'" The
declaration we will reportedly make mentions evils but not <i>tzaros</i>. Why
the omission of <i>tzaros</i>?</p>

<p>There
is a remarkable introduction (Avi Ezri, Nashim, Kedusha), written in a besieged
Yerushalayim exactly one week after the state of Israel was declared. In it,
Rav Shach describes the situation, "on the outskirts the sword kills, indoors
there is dread" (<i>Devarim</i> 32:25), a terrible, evil plight. He asks,
why does the <i>passuk</i> begin with <i>ra'os</i> (evils) and <i>tzaros</i>
(distresses), and end with <i>ra'os</i> alone? Rav Shach answers that <i>tzara</i>,
from <i>tzar</i>, narrow, is not the evil itself, but the despair it triggers.
One feels pressed and depressed. However, when one says that it comes from
Hashem, it is still evil, but it is no longer a <i>tzara</i>. </p>

<p>Knowing
that everything, good and bad, is Divine Providence, enables a measure of
consolation, and even joy in Adar I, even in times of suffering. We pray that
Hashem will increase the joy of Adar by saving us from Hamas, the Amalek of
today, just as he saved us on Purim from Amalek, Haman, of old.</p>
