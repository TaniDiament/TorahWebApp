<p>Two covenants are forged between the Creator
of everything and our holy grandfather, Avraham <i>Avinu</i>, in our <i>parasha</i>.
In the first, the <i>b&#8217;ris bein habesarim</i>, Hashem promises the land
of Israel to Avraham and his descendants; in the second, the <i>b&#8217;ris </i>of
<i>mila</i>, the gift of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is repeated implying that it is
dependent on fulfillment of this commandment. Why does the gift of <i>Eretz
Yisrael</i> only come through the mitzvah of <i>mila</i>? Furthermore, the
Gemara (<i>Shabbos</i> 130a), commenting on the verse in <i>Tehillim</i>, &quot;<span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1513;&#1513; &#1488;&#1504;&#1499;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;
&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1498; &#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;
&#1513;&#1500;&#1500; &#1512;&#1489; </span>&#8211; I rejoice over your word like one
who finds great spoils&#8221; (<i>Tehillim </i>119:162), interprets that this
is referring to the mitzvah of <i>mila</i>. Since the Jewish people have
accepted it with great joy (<span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1513;&#1513;&#1493;&#1503;</span>), it is still celebrated
with great joy. What is the basis of the specific association of joy and the
mitzvah of <i>mila</i>?</p>

<p>The <i>Midrash Tanchuma </i>(<i>Tazria </i>5)
records the following conversation between R. Akiva and the Roman governor,
Turnusrufus (somewhat paraphrased):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turnusrufus asked R.
Akiva, &#8220;Whose handiwork is more beautiful, G-d&#8217;s or
man&#8217;s?&#8221; He responded: &#8220;Man&#8217;s are more beautiful!&#8221;
&#8230; Turnusrufus asked, &#8220;Why are you circumcised?&#8221; He replied:
&#8220;I knew you would ask that, and that is why I preempted [you] and said to
you that the handiwork of man is more beautiful than that of G-d.&#8221; R.
Akiva brought ears [of grain] and cakes. He said to him: &#8220;These are the
handiwork of G-d, and these are the handiwork of man&#8230; Are these [the
cakes] not more beautiful than the ears?!&#8221; Said Turnusrufus to him,
&#8220;If he wanted circumcision, why doesn&#8217;t the baby exit already
circumcised from the womb?!&#8221; Said R. Akiva to him, &#8220;Why does the
baby exit with the umbilical cord still connected to its belly, and the mother
needs to sever it! That which you asked why isn&#8217;t [the baby] already
circumcised, it is because G-d gave the <i>mitzvos</i> to Israel to purify
them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What fundamental theological principles are at
the root of this debate between the saintly sage, R. Akiva, and the wicked
Turnusrufus?</p>

<p>Rav C. Y. Goldwicht <i>zt&#8221;l</i>,<i> </i>founding
Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Kerem B&#8217;Yavneh, under whom I was privileged to
study, elucidates these mysteries as follows:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> One receiving a
free gift never truly owns it in the fullest sense of the term, since his debt
of gratitude constantly impinges upon a sense of true ownership. By contrast,
one who purchases something, even if &#8211; through the beneficence of the
seller &#8211; pays only a discounted price does acquire a sense of total
ownership and the item is truly &#8220;theirs.&#8221; Similarly, there are two
kinds of Divine bestowals: one which is just a gift without any &#8220;purchase
price&#8221; and one which is more similar to a sale whereby the recipient, in
order to receive the Divine blessing, &#8220;pays&#8221; for it through his
actions. Only the latter will securely remain in the domain of the recipient
eternally, and only with regard to the latter will the recipient be granted a
true sense of ownership.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a></P>

<p>The <i>Midrash</i> (<i>Shemos Rabba </i>1:1, also see <i>Berachos </i>5a) teaches:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; this refers
to <i>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</i> who loves Israel, as it is written, &#8220;I loved
you, says Hashem&#8221; (<i>Malachi </i>1:2). [As a result,] He increases their
suffering (perhaps: He raises them with suffering). You find that HKB&#8221;H
gave to Israel three good gifts, and He gave all of them only through
suffering: Torah, the Land of Israel and the World to Come.</P>
</blockquote>

<p>How is causing suffering an expression of
Divine love? Why do these magnificent gifts have to come through suffering?
Based on the fundamental concept Rav Goldwicht presented above, he explains
that Hashem wishes to transform these gifts into a &#8220;purchase&#8221; so
that they become our eternal heritage, not subject to constant Divine scrutiny
whether we are worthy of the gift. The suffering mentioned in this context does
not refer to punishment for sins but to soul-wrenching struggles and <i>mesirus
nefesh</i>, a demonstration of singular, wholehearted devotion to the study of
Torah, to commitment to the land of Israel and to Divine service in general, thus
earning our Olam Haba. This form of suffering serves as the &#8220;purchase
price&#8221; through which these gifts truly become ours.</P>

<p>Based on this, Rav Goldwicht addresses the
above sources concerning the covenant of <i>mila</i>. Hashem created an
imperfect world as proven by R. Akiva to the Roman governor. His goal in doing
so was to allow man to partner with Him in the &#8220;acquisition&#8221; of
Divine blessing. Before the soul descends into the world, the Divine radiance
it enjoys is incomplete pleasure, referred to by Ramchal as &#8220;<i>nahama
d&#8217;chisufa </i>- the bread of embarrassment.&#8221; Circumcision
represents the revelation of the inner sanctity endowed to man by his Creator
enabling him, through wholehearted, selfless devotion to His Creator&#8217;s
will (<i>yissurin</i>) to be worthy of Divine bounty. Only through this effort,
does he earn his eternal reward and succeeds in transforming the &#8220;bread
of embarrassment&#8221; into a complete expression of Divine pleasure in the
World to Come. R. Akiva demonstrated that even the physical world reflects this
truth, namely, that only through hard work is man able to transform the initial
Divine gifts into items of greater beauty. Our bodies are created in an
imperfect state as evidenced by the need to cut the umbilical cord. On a
spiritual plane, the mitzvah of mila represents the need, through hard work, to
fully acquire the Divine blessings granted to us.</P>

<p>This is also why the mitzvah of <i>mila </i>specifically
is associated with joy since absolute joy only comes with something that is
truly acquired through considerable effort . &quot;<span lang=HE
dir=RTL>&#1497;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; &#1499;&#1508;&#1497;&#1498;
&#1499;&#1497; &#1514;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;,
&#1488;&#1513;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1498;</span> &#8211; [when] the toil of
your hands you partake of, happy are you, and it is good for you!&#8221; (<i>Tehillim</i>
128:2).</P>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>II</P>

<p>Our era has seen the Divine blessing of the
return of millions of Jews to the holy land of Israel. The Divine promise to
Avraham <i>Avinu</i> is, with Hashem&#8217;s kindness, once again on the road
to total fulfillment. The Gaza strip, wholly part of the land of Israel (see
Rashi to <i>Bereishis </i>26:2), has always been a seemingly unconquerable
section of the Holy Land. Although often settled, including in our recent era,
by Jewish communities, currently it is solely inhabited by the descendants of
Yishmael. We hope and pray that these last two years of battle, punctuated by
the tremendous <i>mesirus nefesh</i> exhibited by tens of thousands of Jewish
soldiers &#8211; regular troops and reservists &#8211; who have left their
families for months on end to fight against a ruthless, cruel enemy in this
area of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, over a thousand of whom have given their lives
and tens of thousands of whom have lost limbs and are otherwise suffering,
should serve as a tremendous merit for the Jewish people to even more greatly
acquire one of the three gifts given through suffering and allow us to return
and settle this part of the Holy Land as well in the near future.</P>

<p>This Thursday, hundreds of thousands of Jews
will gather in Jerusalem in a demonstration of prayer and solidarity with the
supreme value of Torah study and loyalty to Torah values. To be sure, the
context in which this is being done &#8211; the imprisonment of Yeshiva
students labeled as &#8220;draft-dodgers&#8221; by the Israeli military &#8211;
is fraught with controversy revolving around the proper balance between
devotion to Torah study and army service as well as, more fundamentally, how
religious segments of Jewry should relate to the currently secular State of
Israel.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
Many, even in the religious world, will not be attending, disturbed by the
perception of &#8220;shirking of responsibility&#8221; they perceive in certain
segments of Jewry. Rabbi David Fendel <i>shlit&#8221;a</i>, Rosh Yeshiva of
Yeshivat Hesder Sderot, the students of which certainly were at the center of
the war in Gaza, will be attending. He beautifully explained his decision by
stressing the merit of the prayer by so many Jews, the centrality of Torah
study which is not fully recognized by so many segments in Israeli society, and
the need to find a solution for a proper framework of army service for those
not involved in full-time Torah study. Only further strife and division will be
caused by continuing arrests of Yeshiva students.</P>

<p>I humbly add to Rav Fendel&#8217;s words my
fervent wish that regardless of one&#8217;s stance on this prayer rally, that
it be used as an opportunity to deeply reflect on two out of the three of the
tremendous Divine gifts granted to us by our loving Father in Heaven, Torah and
Eretz Yisrael, and to recall Rav Goldwicht&#8217;s elucidation why both are
only acquired through <i>yissurin</i>, whole-hearted devotion, without
self-centeredness, with a sense of ultimate mission and connection to <i>Klal
Yisrael</i>. May we merit to fully devote ourselves to these two central gifts
and see the day when the various segments of Jewry will live together in
harmony united by the dual values of our holy Torah and the Holy Land, the
reblossoming of both of which we have merited to see before our very eyes.</P>
