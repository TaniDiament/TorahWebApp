<!--text-->

<P>Did the rally of November 14 contravene the belief that <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;
&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span>, Hashem is the only true existent, all-powerful, in control of
all? Do natural (i.e., non-spiritual) initiatives such as the rally in the
current existential <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1506;&#1514;
&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;</span> (crisis) insinuate or reflect a heretical belief in a purely natural,
geopolitical etiology? In adopting natural measures alongside spiritual ones,
are we guilty of professing an idolatrous belief in <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1499;&#1495;&#1497;
&#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;</span>, practical and ontological self-sufficiency?</p>

<P>Let us study a few sample, seminal sources, halachic and
meta-halachic, which delineate some representative specifics of Halacha and broadly
depict its ethos. </p>

<P><span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;
&#1492;&#1512;&#1497; &#1494;&#1492; &#1513;&#1493;&#1508;&#1498;
&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span></p>

<P>One who inquires (if it is permissible to override Shabbos
thereby causing a delay in rendering vital assistance when a life is in danger)
is guilty of bloodshed. (Yerushalmi Yoma 8:5)</p>

<P>When a life hangs in the balance, human effort is required
and potentially decisive.</p>


<blockquote>
<P>(1) When you go out to battle
against your enemy, and you see horse and chariot - a people more
numerous than you - you shall not fear them, for Hashem your God Who
brought you up from the land of Egypt is with you.</p>

<P>(2) It shall be when you draw near
to the war, the Kohen shall approach and speak to the people.</p>

<P>(3) He shall say to them,
"Hear, O Israel, you are coming near to the battle against your enemies;
let your heart not be faint; do not be afraid, do not panic, and do not be
broken before them.</p>

<P>(4) For Hashem, your God, is the
One who goes with you, to fight for you with your enemies, to save you."</p>

<P>(5) Then the officers shall speak
to the people, saying, "Who is the man who has built a new house and not
inaugurated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war and
another man will inaugurate it.</p>

<P>(6) And who is the man who has
planted a vineyard and not redeemed it? Let him go and return to his house,
lest he die in the war and another man will redeem it.</p>

<P>(7) And who is the man who has
betrothed a woman and not married her? Let him go and return to his house, lest
he die in the war and another man will marry her."</p>

<P>(8) The officers shall continue
speaking to the people and say, "Who is the man who is fearful and
fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house and let him not melt the heart
of his fellows like his heart."</p>

<P>(9) when the officers have finished
speaking to the people, the leaders of the legions shall take command at the
head of the people. (Devarim 20; this translation quoted, and subsequent
translations adapted from Artscroll)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<P>The Torah affirms in supernatural, providential terms that
Hashem wages war on our behalf and, accordingly, commands that we trust in Him
and not fear. And yet the Torah also commands in natural, non-providential
terms that we exempt certain classes of individuals from military service
because of the dangers and uncertainties associated with war. And the Torah
concludes by mandating the appointment of commanding officers, who are needed
to conduct the war on a natural, non-miraculous level.</p>

<P>Ramban (Nachmanides) notes these different strands, and
explains how they join to form a coherent, rich tapestry.</p>

<blockquote>
<P>(The Kohen) exhorts them that they
should not be timid and fear their enemies; he tells them not to trust in their
own prowess. Rather that they should direct their heart to God and trust in His
salvation and contemplate that Hashem <i>favors those who fear Him, those who
hope for His kindness</i>.</p>

<P>(The Kohen) states that (God) will fell
(their enemies) by sword and that (the Israelites) will all be saved in the
battle, and not suffer any casualties; for (barring such a degree of divine
involvement) even in victory they would suffer heavy casualties; such is the natural
course of wars.</p>

<P>The Kohen, whose life is
consecrated to the service of God, instructs them to fear God and assures them (of
His protection). But the officers speak in natural terms (lest the new
homeowner <i>et al.</i> die in battle); for in the natural course of events, in
every war people die, from the victorious side as well.</p>

<P>"And they must appoint
commanding officers" - For the Torah commands mitzvos in consonance with
the natural order and stages the miracles for the God-fearing concealed (within
that natural order). For Hashem does not desire to alter the natural
functioning of the world, except when there is no other avenue of rescue, or,
on occasion, to "make known His name to His enemies," as happened
with the splitting of the Sea of Reeds and similar events." (Commentary
to Devarim, <i>ibid</i>.)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<P>Hashem will miraculously save us from our enemies. And yet the
Torah issues a split mandate - we are obligated to have complete, unwavering faith
in His involvement, but also to approach war on a natural level, <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;
&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;</span>,
without relying on miracles.</p>

<P>This two-tiered system, explains Ramban, whereby Providence
crowns our efforts with success allows for <span lang=HE dir=RTL
>&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;
&#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, covert miracles, that do not override natural law. Hashem
providentially, clandestinely operates within natural processes. In most
instances, this is His preferred modus operandi. He wills to eschew <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;
&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, overt, supernatural miracles, and perform <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;
&#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;</span>. Hashem, as it were, is poised to perform covert miracles on our behalf. But we are commanded, as it were, to partner with Him. His
providential involvement does not diminish the need for human initiative and effort;
He will crown our natural efforts with success. Hashem guarantees that He will perform
<span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;
&#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; but not <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;
&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;</span> when the former would suffice. A moment's reflection reveals the frightening implications of not complying with this divine providential principle
and concomitant halachic mandate; quiescent pietism, albeit unmistakably
sincere, is extremely dangerous.</p>

<P>Natural initiatives such as a rally do not insinuate a
belief in <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1499;&#1495;&#1497;
&#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;</span>; they fulfill <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;
&#1491;'</span>, Hashem's will.
They do not encroach upon the belief that <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;
&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;</span>; instead, they implement <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1511;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;
&#1506;&#1493;&#1500; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;</span>, acceptance of the yoke of <i>mitzvos</i>. They do not impede divine
involvement; rather they are a <i>sine qua non</i> for such involvement.</p>

<P>Characteristically, the Torah ordains a binary response when
the Jewish people are attacked, 1) to wage war<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title="">[3]</a> 2) to sound the trumpets<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>.
Rambam<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
(Maimonides) identifies this latter mitzvah with prayer and repentance. Sounding
the trumpets is a form of prayer which the Torah ordains to impress upon us
that our sins have precipitated the danger and suffering, and we must respond
to the <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1506;&#1514;
&#1510;&#1512;&#1492;</span> by
repenting. Nonetheless, we are obligated to simultaneously maximally exert
ourselves in waging war, sparing no effort and marshalling all resources.</p>

<P>The Torah requires human initiative and maximum effort. Human
initiative and effort make a difference, <i>the</i> difference. This halachic
ethos is also embodied in the previously quoted halacha that one who delays in
a situation of <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1508;&#1511;&#1493;&#1495;
&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;</span>, danger
to life, is guilty of bloodshed.</p>

<P>The census at the beginning of the Book of <i>Bamidbar</i>, interprets
Ramban, was ordained because a nation approaching war, <span lang=HE dir=RTL
>&#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;
&#1492;&#1496;&#1489;&#1506;</span>, on
the natural level, needs to know how many soldiers are available to fight.</p>

<blockquote>
<P>We may very cogently suggest an
additional (interpretation for the census). This is how a kingdom prepares for
war. For now (the Israelites) were ready to enter the Land and to engage in
battle with the Amorite kings in Transjordan and all the other (kings in the
land of Canaan). Moshe and the leaders needed to ascertain overall how many
were of an age for military conscription as well as the breakdown within each
tribe; they would then in the Plains of Moab assign (each tribe its task) in
the military campaign. For the Torah does not rely on the miracle "one
will pursue a thousand." And this is the explanation of <i>everyone who
goes out tom the army in Israel</i> - i.e., that the census was being
taken because of the need to organize an army. (Commentary to <i>Bamidbar </i>1:45)<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<P>Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> also employed all relevant natural
means and tactics; hence in year two he approved the request to send <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, spies, and in year forty dispatched
another set.</p>

<blockquote>
<P>And this is a proper strategy for
all conquerors of lands. Moreover, Moshe himself subsequently did the same and
similarly Yehoshua. Therefore, Moshe approved the suggestion to send spies. For
Scripture never relies on miracles; on the contrary, it commands combatants to
arm themselves, to protect themselves, and to lay ambushes, as is found in
Scripture regarding the war at Ai, which was waged according to the word of God
(and yet regular combat procedures were followed). (This natural approach is
evident) in many places (in Scripture). Moshe then consulted with God gave him
permission and told him, "Send forth for yourself men, and let them spy
out the land" so they will get to know it; and based upon their report
you will plan the conquest. (Ramban, <i>ibid</i>. 13:2)<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<P>Ramban clearly explains that naturalness characterizes all
of Halacha; it is not limited to the mitzvah of waging war. "<span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1499;&#1497;
&#1492;&#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1514;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;
&#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;</span>"; the semantics of <a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a><span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1514;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492;</span> are that the Torah always mandates that we
act within the natural realm. Ramban is quite explicit in his sweeping
meta-halachic characterization of Halacha," <span lang=HE dir=RTL
>&#1499;&#1497;
&#1492;&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489; &#1500;&#1488;
&#1497;&#1505;&#1502;&#1493;&#1498; &#1489;&#1499;&#1500;
&#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1504;&#1505;</span>", the Torah never relies on miracles.
Accordingly, any suggestion that the belief of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
>&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;
&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1502;&#1500;&#1489;&#1491;&#1493;</span> warrants passivity and rejects human initiative
specifically contradicts discreet halachos and broadly distorts the ethos of all
of Halacha.</p>

<P>The <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1505;&#1508;&#1512;
&#1492;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1498;</span> also presents and explains the two-tiered system of
divine providence and human initiative.</p>

<blockquote>
<P>Among the underlying purposes of
the mitzvah: Hashem, blessed is He, exercises all-encompassing providence over
human beings, and everything that happens to (them), good or bad, is by His
decree and His command, in accordance with their merit or liability, as (our
Sages) of blessed memory, stated 'A person does not stub his finger down
below, unless (the Heavenly Court) has first issued a decree from Above.'
Nevertheless, a person must protect himself from natural occurrences in the
world, because the Almighty created His world and founded it upon principles of
nature. Thus, He decreed that fire should burn and water extinguish a flame. Likewise,
nature dictates that if a large rock falls on a man's head, it will crush
his brain, and if a person falls from a high rooftop to the ground, he will die.
However, (the Almighty), blessed is He, had compassion on man's body, so
he infused within him a life-soul possessed of intelligence to protect his body
from all harm. He placed both - the soul and its body - within the
sphere of the elements, and (these elements and their laws) govern and act upon
them. In accordance with the dictates of His wisdom the Almighty subjected
man's body because it is physical to (the laws of) nature. He commanded
him to take precautions against accidents (and other natural occurrences). If
he does not exercise caution, then nature to which he is subordinate will take
its toll.</p>

<P>The Torah therefore commands us to install
safeguards in our dwellings and property so that no negligent deaths should
occur; we should not rely upon miracles and endanger ourselves. Indeed, the
Sages stated that anyone who (gratuitously) relies on a miracle, will not be the
beneficiary of one.</p>

<P>You will see that most of the
narratives throughout Scripture illustrate this principle. Even when Israel
would fight a war on Hashem's command, they would wage their war, arm
themselves and conduct all their affairs as if they were relying entirely on natural
means. And, this is the correct course of action, as we have indicated. Anyone
who does not dispute truth out of spite will agree to this. (Mitzvah 546) <a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<P>Divine providence not withstanding Hashem created a world
which is based upon and functions according to natural law. Such is His will. Respect
for His will demands that we operate fully and effectively on a natural level. Otherwise,
God forbid, we are being contemptuous of Hashem and His creation. Passivity and
quietism are not only sacrilegious but dangerous, since one who relies upon a miracle
is assured that he will not be the beneficiary of such. Hence, while we
fervently believe in <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1492;&#1513;&#1490;&#1495;&#1492;
&#1508;&#1512;&#1496;&#1497;&#1514;</span> (individualized divine providence) and <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, we do not rely upon them at all.</p>

<P>Rav Soloveitchik <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1494;&#1510;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;&quot;&#1492;</span> depicts this natural halachic ethos. "The
statement quoted in both the <i>Tur </i>and <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;
&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1506; &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493; &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;
&#1494;&#1492; &#1513;&#1493;&#1508;&#1498; &#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;</span>[10]</a> ...is a cornerstone of halachic thinking."</p>

<blockquote>
<P>The doctrine of faith in God's
charity, <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1493;&#1503;</span>, is not to be equated with the folly of
the mystical doctrine of quietism which in its extreme form exempts man from
his duty of attending to his own needs and lets him wait in "holy"
idleness and indifference for God's intervention. This kind of repose is
wholly contrary to the repose which the Halachah recommends: the one which
follows human effort and remedial action. Man must first use his own skill and
try to help himself as much as possible. Then, and only then, man may find
repose and quietude in God and be confident that his effort and action will be
crowned with success. The initiative, says the Halachah, belongs to man, the successful
realization, to God.</p>

<P>Certainly, "except the Lord
build the house, they labor in vain that build it," but if those who
labor stop building, there will be no house. The Lord wants man to undertake
the task which He, in His infinite grace, completes. (The Lonely Man of Faith)</p>
</blockquote>

<P>The alternative to <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1499;&#1495;&#1497; &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1501;
&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;</span>is not passivity; it is the humble, God-fearing mindset which frames human
initiative and effort. It is the recognition that while "the initiative
belongs to man, the successful realization to God."</p>

<P>It is, of course, immaterial whether we label the current era
as <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;&#1514;&#1488;
&#1491;&#1502;&#1513;&#1497;&#1495;&#1488;</span>, the period which will precede the coming of the Messiah; the dictates
