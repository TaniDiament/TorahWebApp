<P>Western Civilization is imploding.</p>

<P>The lifeblood of the victims had not yet cooled. Civilized
people of conscience were still reeling from shock at the savage slaughter of
babies, beheading, burning people alive, kidnapping, torture, and rape gleefully
perpetrated by Hamas. In that very moment the moral turpitude which is
destroying Western Civilization was on full display. Various groups, notable amongst
them student groups, issued vile, Faustian statements exonerating Hamas for its
savagery and brazenly blaming its victim, Israel, for the carnage. Some
university presidents immediately responded; reprehensibly, they generically
condemned violence, careful not to single out or even reference Hamas. Others, after
an initial sickening silence, prevaricated. Upon days of public pressure and contemplation,
they decided that, in fact, they were opposed to beheading babies but hastened
to "balance" their tepid remarks by expressing profound concern for
the suffering of the innocent Palestinians in Gaza, thereby implicitly or
explicitly condemning Israel's humanitarian, self-defense response to subhuman,
belligerent savagery.</p>

<P>Notably, these "humanitarians" do not comment on
the fate of Arab populations outside of Israel as they languish under brutal,
dictatorial regimes. Tellingly, these academic "moralists" have
been silent throughout the years as Hamas has integrated its terror network
into the civilian infrastructure, <i>inter alia</i>, shielding themselves in, behind
and beneath hospitals, schools, and residential complexes. When other countries
have exercised their inalienable right to self-defense (think of any just, modern
war) we have not heard a chorus of voices expressing concern for civilian
casualties and invoking the laws of war. And rightly so. Should Hitler or Osama
bin Laden or Isis be given carte blanche because of the grim, gruesome, tragic reality
that even defensive wars inevitably involve civilian casualties? Should terrorists
remain forever free to continue massacring innocents because they cruelly and
cynically imbed themselves amongst the civilian population? Civilization cannot
and would not survive such a hypocritical policy of "restraint".</p>

<P>Every person of conscience intuits that outright support for
Hamas or camouflaged support in the form of moral equivocation are odious. Nonetheless,
it is vital that we translate our pre-cognitive intuition into cognitive categories
as that will reveal the existential threat which Hamas' apologists pose to
civilization.</p>

<P>"The species of man is unique, there is no other
species that resembles him in this respect, that he, of his own accord through
his own understanding and contemplation, can discern good and evil and act as he wishes",
writes Maimonides, the great medieval jurist and philosopher (Code of Jewish
Law, Laws of Repentance, ch.5) Humanity is divinely endowed with a capacity for
moral clarity. And, in turn, that moral clarity forms the basis for moral action. The civilized world can only combat forces of evil such as
Nazism, Isis, Al Qaeda, and Hamas with such moral clarity. Moral clarity marshals
the necessary resolve to exercise military might and vanquish evil. Without
moral clarity and resolve, military firepower will never be directed to
vanquish evil. The evil of explicit "moral" support for Hamas, or support
camouflaged in equivocation and equivalences, is that it destroys moral clarity.
Clearly, this form of evil is not academic; it reeks blood. By destroying moral
clarity, it erodes moral resolve and dissipates opposition to evil. It
perniciously acts as evil's fifth column. Evil's fifth column
- the students, professors, administrators, and their co-conspiratorial
ilk beyond academic circles - has and continues to provide moral cover
for the atrocities of Hamas, empowering them to continue their savagery and
barbarism.</p>

<P>Undoubtedly, rabid antisemitism animates the fifth column. In
antisemitic quarters, Jewish blood is of no value and Jewish self-defense is a
war crime. Nonetheless, the fifth column poses a universal threat. This is so
morally because the beheading of babies, the fiery immolation of entire
families, torture, and rape etc. constitute crimes against humanity. And this
is so pragmatically because the Hamas beast, if allowed to torture and devour the
Jews, will then turn its sadistic, predatory, murderous attention to all Westerners
and "infidels".</p>

<P>Hamas, along with all other "pure, unadulterated
evil" terrorist organizations, needs to be militarily destroyed. But that
can only happen if the hypocrisy and evil of its fifth column is peacefully exposed
and defeated. Every Jew and all other people of conscience must participate in
this noble, non-violent effort to restore moral clarity. Educators,
philanthropists, university board members, college bound students and their
parents, heads of corporations, essayists, political pundits and activists, <i>et
al.</i>, and voters on both sides of the political aisle - each acting
within their respective domains with moral clarity - must join forces. (Fortunately,
some individuals and corporations have already taken initial steps in that direction.)
The future of the Jewish people demands that effort. And the future of civilization
depends upon it.</p>
