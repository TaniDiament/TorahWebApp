<P>Rav Kook would sometimes speak about <i>aschalta
d'geulah</i>. Several <i>rabbonim</i> from Hungary would attack him in
their essays in the Hebrew newspapers, arguing that this notion doesn't
make sense - either you have <i>geulah</i> or you don't have <i>geulah</i> - why
did Rav Kook invent a new concept of <i>aschalta d'geulah</i>. The truth
of the matter is that the expression &#8220;<i>aschalta d'geulah</i>&#8221;
appears in the <i>gemarah</i>. The <i>gemarah</i> states that <i>milchomos</i>
(wars) are an <i>aschalta d'geulah</i>. The Chasam Sofer wrote in his
diary that there was a period of time that the city Pressburg was under siege
in the middle of a war. The war had nothing to do with the Jews or with <i>Eretz
Yisroel</i>, and nevertheless the Chasam Sofer understood the <i>gemarah</i> as
saying that all wars in the world are <i>aschalta d'geulah</i>. He
considered this idea as a halachic concept and said and wrote that one is not
permitted to <i>daven</i> that the war should end because you are, in effect,
slowing down the process of the <i>geulah</i>. One might have thought that only
a <i>navi</i> or one who has <i>ruach ha'kodesh</i> could determine that any
given situation is an <i>aschalta d'geulah</i> but the Chasam Sofer did
not require such a condition.</p>

<P>Many years later during World War I a suggestion was made
that the <i>rabbonim</i> should be <i>gozer</i> a <i>ta'anis</i> and everyone
should daven that the war should end. The Minchas Elozer (Munkatcher Rebbe)
dedicated a <i>teshuva</i> to this issue and gave two reasons why he was
opposed to the idea: first, it only makes sense to declare a <i>ta'anis
tzibbur</i> if there is a reasonable possibility that the <i>tzibbur</i> will
do <i>teshuva</i>, and at that time that seemed highly unlikely. Second, he quoted
from the Chasam Sofer's diary that all wars in the world are <i>aschalta
d'geulah</i> and it is highly improper to slow down the process of <i>geulah</i>.</p>

<P>Rashi, in his commentary on the <i>gemarah</i>, does not
seem to agree with the position of the Chasam Sofer. Rashi understood that a
war regarding who is the <i>ba'al ha'bayis</i> of <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> which
the Jews win would be considered an <i>aschalta d'geulah</i>. In order to
determine what should be considered an <i>aschalta d'geulah</i>, we have
to first establish what the definition of <i>geulah</i> is. The Ramban writes in
his introduction to <i>Sefer Shemos</i> that <i>Sefer Bereishis</i> is all
about the three beginnings: the beginning of the world, the beginning of
mankind, and the beginning of the Jewish nation. By the end of <i>Chumash Bereishis</i>
we have been introduced to the <i>avos</i> (Avrohom, Yitzchok, and Yaakov) and
the twelve <i>shevatim</i>. <i>Sefer Shemos</i> then focuses on the first <i>galus</i>
of the Jewish people, and the <i>geulah</i> therefrom. Then the Ramban raises
an objection to this characterization: the Jewish people don't return back to <i>Eretz
Yisroel</i> until after the death of Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i> when they crossed
over the Yarden river under the leadership of Yehoshua bin Nun; not only does the
story of the Jewish people entering <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> not appear in <i>Sefer
Shemos</i>, it does not appear in the <i>Chumash</i> at all! How can we describe
the theme of <i>Sefer Shemos</i> by stating that it deals with the first <i>galus</i>
and the <i>geulah</i> therefrom if the returning to <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> only takes
place in <i>Sefer</i> Yehoshua? The Ramban explains that the main tragedy in <i>galus</i>
Mitzrayim was not so much that the Jews were in <i>chutz la'aretz</i> but
rather that they did not have any <i>hashra'as haShechinah</i>. During
the lifetime of Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov the <i>medrash</i> states that the
<i>avos</i> were like the <i>merkava</i>; they had a <i>hashra'as haShechinah</i>.
By the time we get to the end of <i>Sefer Shemos</i>, we have read the four <i>parshiyos</i>
of <i>Teruma</i>, <i>Tezaveh</i>, <i>Vayakhel</i> and <i>Pekudei</i> which all
deal with the construction of the <i>Mishkan</i>, and the <i>hashra'as
haShechinah</i> in the <i>Mishkan</i> is considered the <i>geulah</i>. It would
appear that the Ramban understood that when the <i>gemarah</i> says that the
first <i>geulah</i> took place in Nissan and the <i>geulah</i> <i>asida</i>
will also take place in the month of Nissan, the first <i>geulah</i> being
referred to is not <i>Yetzias</i> Mitzrayim, rather it is <i>hakomas ha'Mishkan</i>.
During the first twelve days in the month of Nissan, the <i>nesi'im</i>
of the twelve <i>shevatim</i> brought special <i>korbanos</i> for the purpose
of <i>chanukas ha'Mishkan</i>, and in the end of <i>Sefer Yechezkel</i> we read
that when the third <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> will be built we will bring special <i>korbanos</i>
for a period of six and a half months, starting from <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> Nissan
and continuing until after Sukkos.</p>

<P>When <i>Medinas Yisroel</i> was established in 1948, the Chazon
Ish had already moved to <i>Eretz Yisroel</i>. In the biographies of the Chazon
Ish it is quoted that he said at that time that this is the end of the <i>galus</i>
but we still have not experienced the <i>geulah</i>. Many thought that this was
some type of double talk. My impression is that the Chazon Ish is using the
concepts that the Ramban developed: since you have a Jewish government
controlling <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> all the Jews from all over the world were
welcomed to come to <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> and that was considered the end of the
<i>galus</i>. But one only has a <i>geulah</i> when you have a <i>hashra'as
haShechinah</i> with a <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.</p>

<P>Once we define <i>geulah</i> as <i>binyan</i> <i>Beis
Hamikdash</i>, then <i>aschalta d'geulah</i> would refer to some other
events that are going to lead up to the building of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>.
The <i>gemarah</i> in Sanhedrin (20), quoted by the Rambam in the beginning of <i>Hilchos
Melachim</i>, states that there are three <i>mitzvos</i> that have to be fulfilled
in a specific order: establishing a Jewish government controlling all of <i>Eretz
Yisroel</i>, wiping out the nation of Amalek, and building a <i>beis ha'bechira</i>
(a.k.a. the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>). </p>

<P>During the period of the second <i>Beis Hamikdas</i>, the <i>chachomim</i>
added on many <i>yomim tovim</i> <i>d'rabbonon</i> that revolved about major
donations to improving the structure of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>, the <i>hakovas
ha'korbonos</i>, and the institutions of <i>kehunah gedolah</i> and <i>sanhedrin</i>,
both of which are connected to the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. All of these <i>yomim
tovim</i> are listed off in <i>Megilas Taanis</i>. Rashi in his commentary on
the <i>gemarah</i> explains that this <i>sefer</i> was known as a <i>megillah</i>
because it was already written down before the mishna and the <i>gemarah</i>
were permitted to be written down. The <i>gemarah</i> in <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>
states that it is not proper to establish a <i>yom tov</i> after the
destruction of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> because it does not conform to the
definition of <i>Megilas Taanis</i>. The commentaries on the <i>gemarah</i> therefore
raise the issue: how did <i>Chazal</i> have the right in the first place to
establish the <i>yom tov</i> of Purim? According to the <i>gemarah</i>'s
tradition, the story of Purim took place towards the end of the seventy years
of <i>galus Bavel</i> when there was no <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> at all. According
to the Pri Chodosh, establishing a <i>yom tov</i> that has nothing to do with
the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> would be a violation of <i>bal tosif</i>!</p>

<P>The Nesivos, in his commentary on Megilas Esther, suggests
that the <i>chachomim</i> in that generation felt that on the occasion of <i>neis</i>
Purim this was an <i>aschalta d'geulah</i>, i.e. that this would
certainly lead to the building of the second <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. Why so? He
explains that Haman is described in the Book of Esther as an <i>Amoleiki</i>
and when Haman and his whole crew were put to death, that was <i>mechiyas</i>
Amalek, which is step #2 of the <i>mitzvos</i> that lead to the building of the
<i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. Like the Chasam Sofer, the Nesivos also assumed that <i>aschalta
d'geulah</i> is a halachic concept that carries with it halachic
consequences.</p>

<P>Soon after <i>hakomas ha'medinah</i> the German government
offered reparations money to the State of Israel. At that time, many members of
the <i>kenesset</i> felt it to be unethical to accept such money because that
would imply that the slaughter of the millions of Jews will all be forgiven by this
payment. At that time, Rav Soloveitchik spoke for the Mizrachi in New York and
brought out two points: 1. he would tend to agree with that position that we
have no right to imply that all is forgiven, and 2. he heard from his father
that any nation that adopts as a policy to wipe out the entire Jewish people
has the status of Amalek and as such it should not be permissible to take the
money from the German government; just as Shmuel <i>Ha'navi</i>
instructed <i>Shaul Ha'melech</i> that he must not take anything from Amalek,
so too throughout the generations one is not permitted to take anything from
Amalek even if, for example, it is only a fraction of the money that the Nazis
stole from the Jewish people. At that time, some of the relatives of Rav
Soloveitchik who lived in <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> let it be known that they did
not agree with Rav Soloveitchik. They pointed out that the Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim
seems to assume that only those that are biological descendants, <i>ben achar
ben</i>, from the original Amaleikim have the status of Amalek. When this
position was publicized, some <i>talmidei chachomin</i> in America pointed out
that Rav Yisroel Gustman had mentioned a conversation that he had with Rav
Chaim Ozer in the middle of the Second World War. Rav Gustman asked Rav Chaim
Ozer what the halachic status of the Nazis is, and Rav Chaim Ozer responded, that
he would tend to agree with the other <i>gedolim</i> in that generation that
the Nazis should probably be considered like Amalek.</p>

<P>In <i>Parshas Beha'aloscho</i>, the Torah instructs us
that when there is a war in <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> we had a <i>mitzvah</i> to
blow <i>chatzotzros</i>. The Rambam in the beginning of <i>Hilchos Ta'aniyos</i>
understands that to mean that there is a special <i>mitzvah lizok u'lihori'a</i>,
i.e. to offer special <i>tefillos</i> on the occasion. The Chasam Sofer in his
diary wrote that during that war that he experienced in Presburg, they recited <i>Avinu
Malkeinu</i> every day. Even on Chanukah, when we don't say <i>Tachanun</i>, we
still ought to recite <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i>. On Rosh Hashanah we don't say <i>Tachanun</i>
but we do say <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i>. Most probably the correct time to say <i>Avinu
Malkeinu</i> after <i>Shacharis</i> should be right after <i>chazoras ha'shatz</i>
and before <i>Hallel</i>. A <i>talmid chochom</i> from Lakewood pointed out
that in the <i>Siddur Otzer Hatifilos</i> right before <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i>, appears
an explanatory paragraph quoting several <i>acharonim</i> who point out that
the entire <i>Avinu Malkeinu</i> is based on the nineteen <i>berachos</i> of
the weekday <i>shemone esrei</i>. Let us all continue to offer our <i>tefillos</i>
that <i>Hakadosh Boruch Hu </i>fulfill his promise that he will wipe out Amalek
and that He strengthen the hands of <i>Tzahal</i> that they should be able to
fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of wiping out Amalek and that this war should lead
to the final <i>geulah</i>.</p>
