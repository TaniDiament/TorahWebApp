<P>The world is, with the help of G-d and His kindness, possibly
at the cusp of healing - at least for now - from the greatest epidemic that has
hit humanity for decades although the danger lurks of a second breakout.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> To be sure, the
world is no stranger to tragedies of epic proportions: war, famine, disease,
massacres and myriad "natural" disasters. The Jewish people especially
have been victims of targeted persecution because of their religion or race
throughout the ages. But a world-wide crisis of this proportion on so many
planes certainly requires much reflection. Many prominent Rabbinic figures both
here in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and in <i>chutz la'aretz</i> have voiced
their suggestions as to what particular areas of <i>avodas Hashem</i> require
improvement and which are the areas concerning which the Creator of the world
and Giver of the Torah is sending us messages to improve.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> The <i>Tochacha</i>
of <i>parashas B'chukosai</i> is read before <i>Shavuos</i> since this
holiday<i> </i>is also considered a <i>Rosh Hashana </i>(<i>Megilla </i>31b), a
day on which we not only celebrate the momentous event of the giving of the
Torah but is also meant as a day on which to reflect on an individual and
communal level as to how well we are committed to the covenant of Sinai. It is
in light of this perspective that I add these humble words well aware of the
fact that <span lang=HE dir=RTL>&#1502;&#1497;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[R. Shimon b. Yochai taught,] "This is analogous to
one who was punishing his son, and [the son] did not know why he was being
beaten. After he beat him, he said to him, 'Go do what I commanded you to
do for many days already and you didn't pay any attention to [it]
[me].' So too all the thousands who fell [during a plague] in the days of
David only fell because they did not demand the building of the <i>mikdash</i>.
... If even regarding the [generation] who never had a <i>Beis Hamikdash </i>in
their time and it was not destroyed in their time, this happened to them and
they were punished for note demanding it, we, in whose time it was destroyed,
and we do not sufficiently mourn over it, and we do not request mercy [for its
rebuilding] all the more so! Therefore the original pious ones instituted that
we should pray three times a day and instituted in the <i>amida</i>,
'Please, Merciful One with Your abundant mercy, restore Your Presence to
Zion and the sacrificial order to Jerusalem.' And they also instituted
the building of Jerusalem as a separate blessing in the <i>amida</i> and in <i>birchas
hamazon</i>. (<i>Midrash Tehillim (Shochar Tov)</i> 17)</p>

<P>R. Shimon b. Yochai taught ... "They [a large segment
of the Jewish people] ultimately will despise the Kingdom of Heaven, the
kingdom of the house of David and the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i> ... in the days of
Rechav'am (Yorovam) ... Said R. Simon b. Menasia, "Israel will not see a sign of redemption (blessing) ever unless
they return and request all three. This is indicated by the verse, (<i>Hoshei'a
</i>3:5) "Afterward the Children of Israel will return and seek out
Hashem, their G-d" - this refers to the Kingdom of Heaven -
"and David their king" - this refers to the kingdom of the house of
David - "and they shall tremble for Hashem and His goodness (in the End
of Days)" - this refers to the building of the <i>Beis Hamikdash</i>. (<i>Yalkut
Shimoni</i>, Shmuel 106 from <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> 13 with slight differences)</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The aforementioned <i>midrashic </i>teachings underscore the
centrality of longing for <i>geula</i> bringing in its wake the recognition of <i>malchus
Hashem </i>over the entire world, the restoration of the Davidic dynasty, one
which represents the kingdom of Torah in this world, and the <i>mikdash</i>,
the house serving as a place manifesting the Divine Presence specifically among
G-d's beloved people whose fame and centrality affects the entire
world (see <i>Yeshayahu </i>56:7). The first <i>midrash</i> underscores the
connection of a plague, or national pandemic, to an insufficient yearning for <i>mikdash.
</i></p>

<P>The State of Israel has had, in an unprecedented turn of events,
three inconclusive elections over the course of a year. Just recently a
"unity" government was formed with the prime minister currently on
trial for a variety of charges placing even the current government in Israel in
a tenuous state of stability. In addition, almost worldwide, shuls and <i>batei
midrash</i> have been shuttered for several months. Even outdoor prayer has
been banned by many governments and even where allowed has been prohibited by
various Rabbinic authorities. Here in Israel shuls were just recently reopened
after months of closure, subject to strict rules to avoid further spread of
disease. I humbly submit that there are perhaps two crucial messages inherent
in these two seemingly unrelated events. </p>

<P>The current State of Israel has been the subject of much <i>hashkafic
</i>and <i>halachic</i> analysis. <i>Mori v'Rabi </i>Rav Hershel
Schachter <i>shlita</i> has often presented his view that its existence is a
partial fulfillment of the <i>mitzvah</i> of appointing a Jewish king, namely a
Jewish government. The ideal government would be <i>malchus beis Dovid</i>, but
even one not matching this criterion also is included in this commandment.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> His view is
agreed upon by many. Other Rabbinic authorities vociferously debate this
characterization. But all agree that from a Torah perspective, it is certainly
not the ideal model of government both because it is not <i>malchus beis Dovid</i>
and - notwithstanding all of the positive religiously significant developments
which were fostered by it - because it was not founded from the perspective of
Torah fulfillment.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>
As people committed to Torah values, whereas we are certainly bound to be loyal
to governmental authorities and, in at least the worldview in which many
maintain we greatly value all that the State of Israel has accomplished for the
Jewish people,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
we certainly long for the <i>Ribono shel olam</i> to restore the ideal form of
Jewish government. Perhaps a message inherent in the recent uncertainty
regarding the State is meant to awaken us to more fully to long for the ideal
Jewish <i>malchus</i> which we pray for every day. Granted that we value and
thank Hashem for the great gift of <i>Medinat Yisrael</i>, but we view it as a
"transitional government", one preparing the way for the ideal <i>malchus.<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> </i>I
believe this message is all the more important for those who value the <i>Medina
</i>so greatly. Do we sufficiently long for the ideal Torah government of the
Davidic dynasty?</p>

<P>Our shuls and <i>batei midrash</i> are referred to as <i>midkeshei
me'at</i>, mini-temples granted as a Divine gift wherein Hashem <i>yisborach</i>
promises to rest His <i>Shechina</i> even during the long exile (see <i>Megilla </i>29a based on <i>Yechezkel
</i>11:16). But here too, the ideal, glorious resting place for the Divine
presence is the <i>"bayis <u>hagadol</u> v'hakadosh hazeh"</i>,
not just the <i>mikdash me'at</i>. Perhaps the events of these past few
months whereby our shuls were closed to us are meant as a sign for us to
redouble our efforts in praying for the <i>mikdash hagadol</i> in the <i>amida</i>,<i>
</i>in <i>birchas hamazon </i>as mentioned by the above <i>midrash</i> and in
our personal prayers. The prayer of <i>ya'aleh v'yavo</i> as well
as the <i>Mussaf </i>prayer to be recited <i>b'ezras Hashem</i> multiple
times on the upcoming holiday of <i>Shavuos </i>also contain these same themes.
</p>

<P>An enlightening ruling stated in the Talmud <i>Yerushalmi</i>
- actually relevant halachically in these past few months - is most
informative. If a congregation does not have a <i>sefer</i> Torah, should they
read the Torah reading that week from a <i><u>chumash</u></i>? The <i>Yerushalmi</i>
(<i>Megilla </i>3:1 quoted in <i>Beis Yosef </i>143) rules in the negative
since if they would do so, there would be no motivation to acquire a real <i>sefer</i>
Torah. Even though we follow the view that we should read from a <i>chumash</i>
without blessings (see <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> <i>ibid.</i>) so that in some manner
we hear the Torah reading even though not in an ideal fashion, the <i>Yerushalmi</i>'s
message of not being comfortable with a non-ideal situation is most important
and sheds light on the themes discussed above.</p>

<P>Rav Shimshon Pincus zt"l beautifully describes the
urgency of taking advantage of the ten days of repentance with an impactful <i>mashal</i>
I believe very relevant to the current situation as well. A king's son
rebelled against him, and he was exiled from the palace. Wandering aimlessly
through the forest, the prince fell into a pit. Helpless, in need of food and
medical care, he desperately screamed out "Help! Help!" Sure enough,
the king's entourage, making its way near the forest, heard the cries for
help. Hearing his beloved son's voice, the king quickly rushed to the
edge of the pit and asked, "My dear son, how can I help you?" The
son answered, "Father, Your Majesty, I need food! I need doctors!" The
king quickly lowered in tons of food and commanded doctors to jump into the pit
to heal his son. The king asked, "Is there anything else you need?"
The son replied, "No, that's all." The king bid his son
farewell saying, "Maybe next time we pass by, you'll ask for
something else..." So too, explains Rav Pincus, we often solely focus on
our personal needs: continued health, healing, sustenance, family etc. But we
have to member to fervently, with a sense of urgency, ask our Father, the King,
to "take us out of the pit!", to take us out of exile, to restore
His Kingdom in the world and his Holy Temple!</p>

The idle banter of several across the world that this is just a case of world
overreaction to a type of influenza does not in any way reflect the reality of
what has actually happened.</p>

<P><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span

The very attempt at uncovering root causes for tragedy is reinforced by the
oft-quoted powerful words of Rambam in <i>hilchos Ta'aniyos</i>. Those
not possessing specialized <i>ruach hakodesh </i>cannot be certain that their
assessment is correct, but it would appear that this does not exempt communal
leaders from attempting such an analysis with all due disclaimers of possible
error either made explicit or remaining implicit. In a carefully formulated statement
by Rav Elyashiv <i>zt"l </i>and Rav Shteinman <i>zt"l</i> a number
of years ago in calling for improvement in certain <i>mitzvos</i> during the Second
Lebanon War, they wrote that they are not claiming to know that weakness in
those areas caused the <i>tzara</i>, but nevertheless improvement in those
areas will definitely lead to a bettering of the situation if not its elimination.
It is with this spirit, I believe, that the words of our Rabbinic leaders are
given and should be received.</p>

<P><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>Also see Rav Chaim Jachter, "The Halachic Status of the State of Israel" available on koltorah.org.</p>

<P><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title="">[4]</a> An oft-repeated phrase in the Israeli political scene is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>&quot;&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;
&#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;
&#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514; &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492;&quot;</span>. This tension most recently surfaced in barbs hurled between MK Smotrich and MK Lieberman.</p>

<P><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> Just as one recent example, in this pandemic, Israel's governmental guidance has saved countless lives.</p>

<P><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title="">[6]</a> An apocryphal story circulating has one of the <i>Gedolei Yisrael</i> telling one of the prime ministers that he will "hand over the keys" to the <i>melech hamashiach</i>.</p>
