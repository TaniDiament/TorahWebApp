<P>It was a less than a week ago that Jewish
communities outside of Israel read the book of <i>Koheles</i>. In 9:10, &nbsp;the
wise King Solomon admonishes his listeners "<span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>&#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1513;&#1512;
&#1514;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1498;
&#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1499;&#1495;&#1498;
&#1506;&#1513;&#1492;</span> - all that you're able to do with your might/abilities, do."
I was privileged to hear from an <i>adam gadol</i> (who wishes to remain
anonymous) a most powerful understanding of this verse.</p>

<P>In the Talmud there are three stories that
portray making the most of one's potential. Firstly, we find (<i>Kesubos</i> 66b)
that after the destruction of the second <i>Beis HaMikdash</i>, Rav Yochanan <i>ben</i>
Zakai was leaving Yerushalayim and saw a young woman gathering pieces of barley
from the dung of the animals that belonged to Arabs. When she saw the great
Rabbi, she covered her hair and stood before him and asked for his sustenance.
He asked her "Who are you"? she responded, "The daughter of
Nakdimon <i>ben</i> Gurion." He asked her "What happened to your
father's extraordinary wealth?" and she answered that unfortunately
because he did not give charity, he lost his fortune. The Talmud then clarifies
what she meant: we are taught that Nakdimon's daily practice, when he left his
home to go to the study hall, was to have silk carpets laid out before him, and
as he walked, the poor would gather up these expensive carpets and would
sustain themselves with this most clever and extraordinary donation of charity.
The Talmud says the he most certainly was philanthropic, however, what he was
able to, and thus should have, done more, but unfortunately he did not; he
failed to reach his potential.</p>

<P>In the second incident (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 68a),
we are taught that when R' Eliezer was sick, Rabbi Akiva and his
colleagues came to visit him. R' Eliezer asked them "Why have you
come?" and they answered to learn Torah. Rebbe Eliezer said to them
"I foresee unfortunately you will not leave this world with an easy
comfortable passing." Rabbi Akiva then asked, "What will be my
fate?" and R' Eliezer answered, "your passing will be much
more tortuous than theirs". Rashi explains the harsh prediction of R'
Eliezer in the following way: "because you, Rabbi Akiva, have an
incredible mind for study, had you come and studied Torah from me you would
have learned even more Torah than you have accumulated". Once again, the
accusation is one of squandered potential - as much as Rabbi Akiva
learned, and as great as he was, he could have done more.</P>

<P>The third story (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 17b) relates
that after R' Elazer <i>ben</i> Parta and R' Chananya <i>ben</i>
Tradyon were arrested by the Romans, they had the following conversation. R'
Elazer <i>ben</i> Parta said to R' Chananya <i>ben</i> Tradyon, "You
are fortunate that you were only charged by the Romans for committing one
offense while I was charged for committing five." R' Chanina
responded, "How fortunate you are that despite the many charges, you will
be saved, and woe unto me for having been charged with but one offense, and I
will not be free, but suffer grave consequences. You will be freed because you
have the merit for both studying and teaching Torah and at the same time the
merit of <i>gemilus chassadim</i>, while I am charged with teaching and
disseminating Torah, but I did not have the merit of <i>gemilus chassadim</i>
to save me." The Talmud questions the statement of R' Chananya by
reminding us that he served as the <i>gabbai tzedaka</i>, a trustworthy
individual who discharged charity for the needy. The Talmud answers with the
refrain used in the above two situations, i.e. yes he was involved with <i>chessed</i>,
however he did not fulfill his potential and maximize his actions with
accordance with his ability.</P>

<P>I'd like to offer a suggestion as to why the
Talmud provides us with the insight and shortcomings of these three great
individuals. Rav Shimshon Refael Hirsch <i>zt"l</i> teaches that in many
places the Torah teaches in the extreme. For example, the Torah does not
legislate that if a Jew dies, that individual is to be buried, rather it teaches
(<i>Devarim</i> 22:23) that if a Jew was unfortunately stoned by the <i>Sanhedrin</i>,
the body was to be hung and the individual buried on that day. From here we
learn that if the criminal is to be buried, most certainly each and every Jew
is to be afforded this service. Similarly, when the Torah teaches (<i>Shemos</i>
23:4-5) that if one encounters the ox of their enemy or his donkey wandering,
he shall surely return it to him and, furthermore, if he sees the animal or one
that he hates crouching under its burden, and one's instinctive reaction would
be to refrain from helping him, the Torah ordains that he must assist the one
that he hates. The Torah once again teaches in the extreme that if this
behavior is required towards an enemy, or the more so is one to be responsible
to assist his fellow Jew. Why, one might ask, does the Torah teach to the
extreme? Why not simply say that if one encounters the animal of his neighbor
he should return it and assist the neighbor?</p>

<P>I believe that Ravina and Rav Ashi included these three
narratives in the Talmud to teach us the lesson that if these three great
individuals were taken to task from On High, even though they excelled in their
respective ways, for not performing up to their full potential, each individual
Jew will also be held accountable if they do not fulfill their potential. This
is what King Solomon meant when he began the above cited verse, "All",
not some of, or most of, one's potential, but <u>all</u> one's potential is to
be actualized. Understandably, we are nowhere close to the level of the three
great <i>tzadikim</i> mentioned above, but the lesson for all of us is we all can,
and must, do more.</p>

<P>A further elaboration of this thesis is found in Chovos Halevavos
(<i>Shaar Chesbon Hanefesh</i>, chapter 3), whereby <i>Rabbeinu</i> Bachya
teaches that one is to examine his growth and the effort exerted in his
religious and spiritual observance. He gives the following parable: a master
gave his servant sufficient seeds to plant a sizable field, but the servant
utilized only part of the seeds for the field while the rest of the seeds he
used for his own personal field. When the master saw that his field was only
partially sowed, he confronted his servant and told him he would be held
accountable for failing to do what he could have and should have done and
instead used/stole the seeds for his own personal use. <i>Rabbeinu</i> Bachya is
teaching us that too often, we could use our energies towards greater spiritual
accomplishment, serving Hashem and benefitting our fellow man with greater
results. Unfortunately, we squander these talents and use them for our own
personal gain.</p>

<P>Finally, the Talmud (<i>Berachos</i> 32b)
teaches that four areas of man's endeavors require strengthening: Torah study,
the practice of good deeds, praying, and pursuing a livelihood. Rashi explains
the term "strengthening" to mean to strengthen oneself constantly
with all of their capabilities. We are to constantly strive to improve
ourselves in these areas. Each one knows within the confines of his heart that
there is always room for improvement.</P>

<P>There is a Jewish response to tragedy. The
Torah (<i>Bamidbar</i> 10:9) teaches that, "When you go to war in your
land against an enemy who oppresses you, you shall call out in prayer, sound
the trumpets, and you shall be recalled before Hashem your G-d. and you shall
be saved from your foes." Interestingly, there is a difference of opinion
between the Rambam and Ramban whether there is a biblical <i>mitzvah</i> to
pray daily. The Rambam is of the opinion that there is a biblical <i>mitzvah</i>
to pray daily (based on <i>Devarim</i> 10:20), while the Ramban believes (based
upon the above cited verse) that only in times of crises there is a biblical <i>mitzvah</i>
to pray.</P>

<P>The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Ta'aniyos</i>, 1:1-3)
codifies the positive <i>mitzvah</i> to cry out at a time of crisis. Moreover,
he teaches that this cry is one of the paths of repentance, and that one should
realize that our actions and interactions have caused the tragedy. As Sefer
Yonah proclaims (1:12), "For I know that it is because of me that this
terrible storm is upon you." Each individual must feel that they have
unfortunately contributed to this horrific occurrence. On the other hand, if
one simply believes that antisemitism is purely happenstance, and not a direct
"hit" from <i>Above</i> due
to our actions, in the Rambam's words (<i>ibid</i>), "such belief causes
man to remain attached to their evil ways." Rather (and I personally feel
inadequate to give <i>mussar</i> to others), each individual has to carefully
consider how <u>he</u> can improve in the areas of Torah, <i>avodah</i> and <i>gemilus
chassadim</i>.</p>

<P>Torah: we don't realize sufficiently that when
one is privileged to study Torah, whether in a group setting, with a <i>chavrusa</i>,
or even alone, one is imbibing Godliness. The Zohar teaches that, "He, His
Torah, and Israel are One." Therefore, an increase in one's Torah study brings
more Godliness into this world. Our studying with greater effort will hopefully
cause Him to temper the harsh decree upon our people and our land. The Talmud (<i>Makos</i>
10a) teaches that the success of our soldiers on the battlefield was contingent
on the Torah learning in Yerushalayim. What emerges from above is that each
individual's additional Torah learning will make a real difference.</p>

<P><i>Avodah</i>: prayer is the second pillar
upon which our nation stands. One dare not have the feeling that since they
cannot do anything else, they might as well as say <i>Tehilim</i>. Nothing can
be farther from the truth. Prayer and recitation of <i>Tehilim</i> helps
significantly. This is derived from the Torah: the Jewish people were told (<i>Bamidbar</i>
31:2-6) to send a thousand soldiers from each tribe to go to war against Midyan,
and the Talmud teaches that indeed each tribe conscripted three thousand
soldiers, splitting their assignments a follows: one thousand to engage in
battle, one thousand to assist the soldiers, and one thousand to pray. The Jew
fights with prayer! Praying, as well as learning Torah, effects and changes the
spiritual environment about us, and this change can effect a change in the
Heavenly decree.</p>

<P><i>Gemilus chassadim</i>: it is so sad that
over the past several months we saw too many public demonstrations reflecting a
lack of unity and a lack of respect for fellow Jews with different ideologies.
One day of horror from the Amalek animals has completely changed the
environment. To share just a few examples: a Rabbi in <i>Eretz Yisroel</i> saw
an announcement asking for people to host families from the South. He called
forty-five minutes later and was told, you are way too late, we already found
everyone a place. He asked how many families needed to be housed? The voice at
the other end responded, about 6,000. They found homes for 6,000 families in
forty-five minutes! Secondly, many restaurants in Tel Aviv wanted to help the
war effort by sending food to the soldiers. They were rejected because their
facilities were not <i>kosher</i>. They immediately called the Rabbinate and <i>kashered</i>
their restaurants. One more example out of literally thousands: on the second
night of the war, ten o'clock at night, a father saw his seventeen-year-old
daughter dressed up and about to leave the home. He asked where she was going.
She answered, "there's a wedding with very few women and girls to dance
with the <i>kalah</i>. I am going to dance." <i>U-mi k'amcha Yisroel</i>!</P>

<P>We, too, have to implement the third pillar.
I, unfortunately, know personally of families where one member of the family
doesn't speak to others. Families where parents and siblings don't communicate.
Even if you believe you are right but know the other side is hurting, repair
the damage. Be big. Take the initiative and reach out to that individual that
you have not spoken to in years. Learn from our dear soldiers who are willing
to make the ultimate sacrifice and extend the painful effort to repair the
breakdown of <i>ahavas Yisroel</i>. <i>Ahavas Yisroel</i> is not only to
respect and love your peers and those with whom you associate. When someone
cried to a wise Rav that their relative has a tattoo, his response was, that is
an issue between them and G-d; your job, however, is to love them since they
are a Jew.</p>

<P>None of us come near the level of Nakdimon <i>ben</i> Gurion,
R' Akiva, or R' Chananya <i>ben</i> Tradyon, but all of us can
learn to implement the teaching of Shlomo <i>HaMelech</i>: "All that is in
your power to do, do. Finally, in our <i>Mussaf</i> on Rosh Hashannah we
acknowledge that Hashem inspects <i>ma'aseh ish upe'kudaso</i>
- the actions of man and the fulfillment of his earthly mission. Everyone
is given a personalized <i>tafkid</i> - a purpose and mission to fulfill
in this world. Our trying and doing just a little bit more: Torah study, taking
prayers seriously by taking upon ourselves not to talk during davening, or to
undertake to know the meaning of the prayers, and to truly demonstrate <i>ahavas</i>
Yisroel by feeling and repairing the pain of another Jew, will help facilitate
in no small way a better outcome in this horrific war. </p>
