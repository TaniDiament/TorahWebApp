<P><u>The Question</u></p>

<P>The pivotal question of attending secular college has in the
past two months been recast. Previously the question centered (primarily but
not exclusively) upon the alarming rate of assimilation. Alongside that
life-and-death consideration, a new factor (relevant to many but not all
secular colleges) has emerged: the deplorable (in)action and (lack of) speech
of university/college presidents in reacting to pro-Hamas demonstrations on
their campuses and, more generally, all forms of vile antisemitism. Is it
permissible for our children to seek admittance to a college or graduate school
whose administration has refused to condemn student groups who justify, and
even celebrate, the October 7 atrocities of Hamas? Is it permissible to teach
in these institutions?</p>

<P><u>Background and Context</u> </p>

<P>To be clear the question arose before the three university
presidents testified before Congress, and thus is not limited to those three
schools. Their disgraceful, "contextual" response to calls for
genocide against Jews was pure evil, but neither new nor revelatory. It merely
magnified their (and other presidents') initial reprehensible reaction. Hamas'
avowed goal is genocide; the unspeakable atrocities of October 7 were intended
to advance that murderous goal. And thus, supporting Hamas and their actions
unambiguously supports genocide. Accordingly, in their refusal to condemn
student groups who identified with Hamas and justified and even celebrated
their atrocities, the presidents had already condoned calls for genocide. Their
brazen congressional testimony merely underscored the evil. Whereas previously they
spoke non-verbally ("Not to speak is to speak"), in their testimony
they articulated their previous, non-verbal speech.</p>

<P>Invoking the First Amendment protection of free speech as a defense
for allowing calls for intifada and genocide is an obvious sham. No campus
would tolerate a call to lynch Blacks, or any other racial or ethnic group. And
rightly so. Allowing calls for genocide and intifada has nothing to do with
free speech and everything to do with monstrous evil and vicious hatred.</p>

<P>The university presidents, in allowing the student calls for
intifada on their campuses, were guilty of an even greater evil than the
students themselves. An insight provided by our Sages in the context of <i>lashon
hara</i>, "evil speech", illuminates this point. <i>Lashon Hara </i>can
kill<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, and "One
who accepts the <i>lashon hara </i>bears more responsibility than the one who
spoke."<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> One who speaks <i>lashon hara</i>, if ignored, is powerless and harmless. His evil speech would simply reflect badly upon himself. <i>Lashon hara </i>becomes
toxic when validated by its audience.</p>

<P>Had the university presidents acted morally, and
immediately, unequivocally condemned the students' words and actions,
they would have helped to disarm these evil, antisemitic forces. The students
would have been dismissed as ignorant, immature, impetuous rabble-rousers. Instead,
by condoning the student support for genocide, the university presidents
legitimized and mainstreamed their murderous words. The magnitude of their evil
becomes apparent when we reflect upon one of the most chilling lessons of history:
speech, which goes unchallenged, segues to action.</p>

<P><u>The Relevant Halachic Principle</u></p>

<P>Having sketched some of the background and context we (re-)turn to our query as to the <i>halacha </i>concerning colleges and universities which have condoned celebrations of the October 7 atrocities and calls for genocide.</p>

<P>Attending a (non-sectarian) college does not entail
identifying with any ideology. It is akin to shopping in a supermarket which
sells kosher and non-kosher items. Patronizing the store does not <i>eo ipso </i>endorse
everything sold. So too, attending a university does not <i>eo ipso </i>endorse
everything taught.</p>

<P>There is, however, another consideration. When a Jew denigrates
himself in the public square, he is <i>mechallel es </i>Hashem, profanes the
name of God. The Jewish people are Hashem's chosen<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> and He
identifies Himself with them.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Accordingly, when a Jew publicly denigrates himself, as it were, he denigrates Hashem.</p>

<P>The Talmud presents this prohibition of self-denigration in
the context of accepting charity. One is not allowed to do so in the public
square if he has any other recourse. By gratuitously accepting alms before the
eyes of the world, he denigrates himself and thereby the Jewish people. This constitutes
a <i>chilul Hashem</i>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a> If, however, he has no other recourse, he is permitted to publicly accept the charity. It is not denigrating to do what is necessary for one's
livelihood.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> </p>

<P><u>Applications and Implications</u></p>

<P>The prohibition of self-denigration, while presented in the
context of accepting charity is clearly operative in other contexts, such as
ours, as well.</p>

<P>Many colleges have condoned demonstrations justifying, and
even celebrating (<i>sic </i>sick!) the Hamas atrocities of October 7. They
have either implicitly or explicitly accommodated support for genocide. Our
children's future livelihood or professional opportunities do not in any
way depend upon their attending these undergraduate schools. Accordingly, for
our children to gratuitously apply for the "privilege" of attending
such schools is the height of obsequiousness. It is difficult to imagine a more
egregious form of self-denigration. We are effectively proclaiming, "You
can condone and even celebrate the torture, rape, beheading and immolation of
our brothers and sisters, and yet we will still seek the
"privilege" of attending your school." Such obsequiousness! Such
self-denigration! And, thus, applying to and attending these schools is
unquestionably a <i>chilul Hashem</i><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a>. Politically motivated back-pedaling, cagey
"clarifications" and hollow expressions of regret are worthless. A
change of administration and direction are needed. Barring those changes, it will
remain a <i>chilul Hashem</i> to attend any of these colleges.</p>

<P>Providing for one's livelihood, however, is not
denigrating and thus teaching in these schools is permissible, as per the Talmudic
distinction above. Additionally, the professor-university relationship is bilateral,
and its bilateralism dispels obsequiousness; such bilateralism, however, does not
exist within the student-university relationship.</p>

<P>The propriety of applying to a graduate school under the
aegis of these universities is more nuanced. The dispensation of pursuing
one's livelihood may be relevant. If there is no comparable program in
terms of training or professional advancement in an unsullied university, it
would be permissible to apply. Additionally, in some instances graduate schools
have forged an identity uniquely their own, independent of their parent school.
In such instances, arguably, the position of the university administration does
not reflect upon the school. This angle requires careful consideration and
further thought.</p>

<P><u>Appendix</u></p>

<P>The halachic designation of self-denigration and obsequiousness
as forms of <i>chilul Hashem</i> remarkably converges with the <i>halachos </i>of
<i>kiddush Hashem</i>, sanctifying God's name,<i> </i>and <i>chilul
Hashem</i> as they are expressed in martyrdom. The obligation of <i>kiddush
Hashem</i> at a time of governmental persecution, according to Rambam<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>, includes
sacrificing one's life to fulfill a <i>mitzvas aseh</i>, positive
commandment, even though he may be forcibly prevented from doing so. This
underscores that the obligation of <i>kiddush Hashem</i> is not the fulfillment
of the <i>mitzvah per se </i>but the heroic resoluteness and steadfastness (not
capitulating to persecution). </p>
