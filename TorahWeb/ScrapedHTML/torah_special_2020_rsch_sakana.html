<p><i>Editor's note: more on this topic from Rav Schachter, as well as Dr. Daniel Berman and Rabbi Dr. Aaron Glatt, can be found at <a href="../../../audio/rsch_031920.html">this link</a>.</i></p>
<p>Many have the mistaken impression that the Jewish religion places much emphasis on death and respect for the dead; after all, we recite <i>kaddish</i>, <i>yizkor</i>, observe <i>shiva</i>, and <i>yahrzeit</i>, etc. This is a gross misunderstanding. The respect that we show for the dead is a carryover from the respect that we show for the living. The <i>Gemorah</i> (<i>Kesubos</i> 17a, see <i>Shitah Mekubetzes</i>) tells us that whenever there is a conflict between <i>kovod ha'chayim</i> and <i>kovod ha'meisim</i>, <i>kovod ha'chaim</i> takes precedence. When the <i>chevra kadisha</i> brings in the <i>aron</i> at a funeral, everyone stands up. People mistakenly think that we stand up out of respect for the <i>niftar</i>, but in many cases we never stood up for him when he was alive, so why should we stand up for him now that he passed away? The Bartenurah (<i>Mishnayos Bikurim</i> 3:3) explains that we are not standing up out of respect for the <i>niftar</i> but rather out of respect for the members of the <i>chevra kaddisha</i> who are presently involved in the fulfillment of a <i>mitzvah</i>. The respect for the living is based on the premise that all human beings were created <i>b'tzelem Elokim</i>. When the Torah requires us to demonstrate <i>kovod ha'meis</i>, it means that even after the person passed away and no longer has <i>tzelem Elokim</i>, i.e. a <i>neshama</i>, we still have to act respectfully towards the body because it used to have a <i>tzelem Elokim</i>.</p>
<p>Of the six hundred and thirteen <i>mitzvos</i>, one of the most important is the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>v'chai bohem v'lo sh'yomus bohem</i> (<i>Yoma</i> 85b). Not only does the <i>halacha</i> require that if there is a <i>sofek sakanah</i> we must violate almost all of the <i>mitzvos</i> in the Torah to save a life, but we are also required to do so even if there is only a <i>s'fek s'feika</i>, a remote possibility(<i>Yoma</i> 85a). The <i>Gemorah</i> (<i>ibid</i>) adds that even if the likelihood is that by violating <i>Shabbos</i> or whatever other <i>aveira</i> we most probably will not be saving anyone's life, we still do not abstain from the action due to that likelihood (<i>rove</i> - majority).</p>
<p>When <i>Bnei Yisroel</i> were traveling in the <i>midbar</i> for 40 years, the weather conditions were such that there was a slight <i>sakanah</i> in performing <i>bris milah</i>. Most of the <i>sh'votim</i> did not fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> except for <i>sheivet Levi<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a></i>. They had an Orthodox rabbi among them, i.e. Moshe <i>Rabbeinu</i>. Why didn't all the shevatim ask him what to about this <i>sofek sakanah</i>? If it is a real <i>sofek sakanah</i> he should not have permitted <i>sheivet Levi</i> to perform the <i>mitzvah</i> despite their pietistic protests, and if the <i>sofek sakanah</i> was so insignificant that it simply should have been dismissed, why didn't he insist that all the <i>shevatim</i> perform the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>milah</i>?</p>
<p>The <i>Gemorah</i> (<i>Yevamos</i> 12b) tells us that the answer is to be found in <i>Tehillim</i> (116:6), "<i>Shomer p'soyim Hashem</i>." Whenever there is a slight <i>sofek sakanah</i> that is nowhere near fifty-fifty<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>, the <i>halacha</i> declares that it depends on the attitude of the patient. If the patient whose life is at risk (or the parent of the patient who is responsible for his well-being) is personally not nervous about the danger, then the <i>halacha</i> does not consider it a <i>sofek sakanah</i>; we apply "<i>Shomer p'soyim Hashem</i>." But if the patient whose life is at risk is nervous and concerned about the <i>sofek sakanah</i>, then the <i>halacha</i> requires us to act based on, "<i>V'chai bohem v'lo sh'yomus bohem</i>", and the <i>sofek sakanah</i> takes precedence over almost all of the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah. <i>Shevet</i> Levi had <i>bitachon</i>, and therefore were not concerned, and therefore for their children it was not considered a <i>sofek sakanah</i>, but with respect to the other <i>shevatim</i> who were concerned it was in fact a <i>sofek sakanah</i>, so every <i>shevet</i> was acting <i>k'din</i>.</p>
<p>However, if one individual is not concerned, but the nature of the <i>sakanah</i> is such that everyone is interdependent and the individual who personally is not nervous may possibly spread a disease to others who are concerned about its spread, then the concept of <i>Shomer p'soyim Hashem</i> does not apply. The individual who is not concerned does not have the right to determine for the others who are concerned that there is no <i>sakanah</i> for them.</p>
<p>The Rakanti<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> relates that one of <i>Ba'alei Ha'tosfos</i> was deathly sick before Yom Kippur and the doctors warned him that if he fasts he will certainly die but if he eats on Yom Kippur there is a slim chance that he may survive. He decided to fast, and of course he died. All of the <i>Ba'alei Ha'tosfos</i> were upset over his decision and felt that he went against the <i>halacha</i>.</p>
<p>If a terrorist threatens to kill me unless I violate one of the <i>mitzvos</i> of the Torah, the <i>halacha</i> usually is that <i>pikuach nefesh</i> takes precedence over most of the <i>mitzvos</i> in the Torah. What if an individual wants to put up a fight knowing that he may well lose his life but thinks that by being <i>moser nefesh</i> he will fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>kiddush</i> Hashem? This matter was a famous dispute amongst the <i>Rishonim</i>. The Rambam's opinion is that one may not volunteer to give up his life <i>al kiddush</i> Hashem when not required by <i>halacha</i> because this is tantamount to suicide<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>. Many other Rishonim disagreed with the Rambam. However, if there is no terrorist pressuring me to violate my religion, but there is merely a dangerous situation of sickness then all of the <i>Ba'alei Ha'tosfos</i> agreed with the Rambam that it would <u>not</u> constitute a <i>midas chassidus</i> to ignore the <i>sakanah<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a></i>.</p>
<p>In determining what is a <i>sakanah</i> and what is not, the practice of the <i>Tanoim</i> always was to follow the doctors of their generation. Every so often the Rambam would take a stand on a medical issue against what it says in the <i>Gemorah</i> and the Chasam Sofer (<i>Teshuvos, Yoreh Deah</i> #101) explains that the Rambam was a doctor and he did exactly as the <i>Tanoim</i> did, namely, to follow the doctors of his generation. The Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 331:9) also says explicitly that we follow the doctors of our generation even in contradiction to the medicine recommended in the <i>Gemorah</i>. We should certainly do the same as the Rambam and the Shulchan Aruch and follow the doctors of our generation in determining what is considered a <i>sakanah</i> and what is not considered a <i>sakanah</i>.</p>
<p>Some well-meaning individuals have blown out of <i>halachic</i> proportion the significance of <i>tefillah b'tzibur</i> and <i>talmud Torah b'rabim</i> and have opted to ignore the <i>sofek sakanah</i> presented by the corona virus when in conflict with these two most important <i>mitzvos</i>. We live in a generation where many <i>b'nei</i> Torah tend to exaggerate the significance of Torah and <i>tefillah</i> relative to other <i>mitzvos</i>. Although their intention is certainly <i>l'shaim Shomayim</i>, we must all keep in mind that when <i>paskening shailos</i>, one may not rely on an exaggeration.</p>
<p>All exaggerations by definition are <i>sheker</i> - a misrepresentation of the truth of the Torah. Rav Chaim Volozhiner signs off quite a few of his <i>teshuvos</i> saying, "<i>Keil Emes, Nosan lanu Toras Emes, u'bilti el ho'emes eineinu </i>- the true God gave us the true Torah, and we only look for the truth." Any exaggeration in the area of Torah and <i>halacha</i> is clearly a misrepresentation of our religion. The commentaries on Shulchan Aruch (<i>Yoreh Deah</i> 157) refer to the comments of the Maharshal in his <i>sefer</i> <i>Yam Shel Shlomo</i> (Bava Kamma 38a) that to misrepresent a law of the Torah constitutes an <i>aveira</i> related to <i>avodah zorah<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></i> and as such would be subject to the principle of <i>yeihoreig v'al ya'avor</i>.</p>
<p>With respect to a <i>sofek sakanah</i> the <i>halacha</i> clearly requires that we go extremely <i>l'chumrah</i>. Especially religious Jews, who know that they are charged with a mission in life, should certainly be extremely <i>machmir</i> on matters of <i>sofek sakanah</i>.</p>
<p>Although every word of a poem appears in the dictionary, the poet conveys an idea by putting the words in a certain order. So too, different people can have the same ideas and the same principles, but if you put them in a different arrangement you have changed the whole understanding of each one of the principles<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>. Once you exaggerate the significance of any particular mitzvah, you have misrepresented the whole picture of <i>kol haTorah kula</i>.</p>
