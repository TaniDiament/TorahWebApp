<p align="center" style="text-align:center;">I</p>
<p>The Torah describes the process of purification from <i>tzara'as</i>, in which the Kohen must take birds, cedar wood, red wool (<i>shni tola'as</i>) and hyssop (<i>aizov</i>) (<i>Vayikra</i> 14:4). Rashi interprets (as translated by Artscroll), "Since afflictions come about because of malicious talk (<i>lashon hara</i>) which is an act of verbal twittering, birds that twitter and chirp constantly were required for purification. Because afflictions come as a result of haughtiness, what is the cure for his affliction? He should lower himself from his arrogance like a worm (<i>tola'as</i>), and like hyssop (an herb which does not grow tall)."</p>
<p>When <i>tzara'as</i> is diagnosed, the Kohen quarantines that person to one house (Rashi <i>ibid</i> 13:4); while he is impure, he must stay in in isolation (<i>badad</i>). Rashi explains, "since he caused a parting (a dispute) by speaking leshon hara, he, too, shall be set apart."</p>
<p>"This is the law of the <i>metzora</i> on the day of his purification" (<i>ibid</i> 14:2). The Medrash Raba (<i>ibid</i> 16:2) explains the etymology of <i>metzora</i> as coming from <i>motzi shem ra</i>, slandering someone falsely. While <i>lashon hara</i> is forbidden even if it is true, slander is much worse (<i>Chofetz Chaim</i> 1:1).</p>
<p>The Gemara (<i>Shabbos</i> 33a-b) teaches that <i>askara</i>, the most difficult death (<i>Berachos</i> 8a), is a punishment for <i>lashon hara</i>. The Gemara's source for this assertion is, "The mouth of the liars will be stopped, <i>yisacheir</i>", literally choked, which connotes <i>askara</i> (as Rashi explains, a disease that chokes). This punishment is limited to liars, i.e. <i>motzi shem ra</i> (<i>Maharsha</i>).</p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center;">II</p>
<p>All of Rabbi Akiva's students died because they did not honor one another. They all died a difficult death - <i>askara</i> - between <i>Pesach</i> and <i>Shavuos</i> (<i>Yevamos</i> 62b). The Maharal explains that honoring a friend is the essence of life, and leads to longevity (<i>Megila</i> 27b). It is literally the way of life (<i>Brachos</i> 28b), indicating that these students who died did not properly honor their friends.</p>
<p><i>Askara</i> begins in the mouth and ends in the throat, the source of speech which defines human life. "Man became a living soul" (<i>Bereishis</i> 2:7) is rendered by Onkelos as, "a speaking soul." <i>Askara</i> is so called because the throat, the source of speech and life, is choked (<i>niskar</i>).</p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center;">III</p>
<p>The Rambam (<i>Hilchos Ta'aniyos</i> 1:1-3) writes:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
 it is a Torah commandment to cry out to Hashem when a crisis besets the community...such as a plague (<i>dever</i>)...this is the path of <i>teshuva</i>, for when a crisis comes and they cry out to Hashem, all will know that because of their misdeeds they were punished. This prayer will cause the crisis to be removed from them. But if they will not cry out, but instead say, this is a natural occurrence which happened by chance, this is a path of cruelty which causes them to cling to their misdeeds and can add to even greater troubles. This is what the Torah states, "If you will not heed Me and will be indifferent, I will be indifferent to you, with a vengeance" (<i>Vayikra</i> 26:27,28). That is, when I bring a crisis upon you so that you repent, if you say it happened by chance, I will respond with vengeance to your indifference.
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis which affects all of mankind. The Rambam enjoins us to view it as a wake-up call to heartfelt <i>tefila</i> and <i>teshuva</i>. Nearly a century ago, the Chofetz Chaim warned that a natural disaster in the Far East was Hashem's call to <i>Am Yisrael</i> to repent. "I have destroyed nations...I thought that you would fear Me, that you would learn a lesson" (<i>Tzefania</i> 3:6,7). If the lesson is not learned, <i>Am Yisrael</i> itself will suffer (Letters of the <i>Chofetz Chaim</i>, no. 30).</p>
<p>The present crisis, which originated in the Far East, has taken many lives. We all live in fear, isolation and apart, many in quarantine. Many victims are torn from their families as they enter hospitals, dying alone, mostly because of the inability to breathe. While we are unable to identify a particular misdeed for which we should repent, it behooves us all, at all times, to avoid <i>lashon hara</i> and <i>motzi shem ra</i> associated with <i>askara</i>. This is especially timely in the week of <i>Parshas Tazria-Metzora</i>, when verbal (and other forms of gossip and) twittering is named as the primary cause of <i>tzara'as</i>, and during <i>Sefira</i> when Rabbi Akiva's students died of <i>askara</i> because of interpersonal failings.</p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center;">IV</p>
<p>Aharon <i>HaKohen</i> offered the <i>ketores</i> (incense) to atone for the people. He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped (<i>Bamidbar</i> 17:12,13). As such, it is recommended to recite <i>Pitum Haketores</i> daily, even for those who usually say it only on Shabbos after Mussaf (<i>Pele Yoetz</i>, <i>Dever</i>).</p>
<p>But what caused the plague in the first place? It was caused by the paradigmatic dispute which was not for the sake of Heaven (<i>Avos</i> 5:20), that of Korach and his entire company. This began as a family feud (Rashi, <i>Bamidbar</i> 16:1) over leadership, and fueled by rabble-rousers it ensnared multitudes, including great God fearing men (<i>Ha'amek Davar</i>).</p>
<p>More important than reciting <i>Pitum Haketores</i> is eliminating disputes, both in families and within and between communities. These two responses - stopping <i>lashon hara</i> and seeking peace - are indeed the answers to the question we all ask at times of rampant death: "Who is the person who desires life and who loves days of seeing good?" (<i>Tehilim</i> 34:14,15)</p>
<p>As in the case of Korach, disputes often result from hubris, as does <i>tzara'as</i>. To be purified from <i>tzara'as</i>, and to end a plague, one must lower himself from his arrogance, as Rashi teaches.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crises has not only led to difficult deaths and widespread illness. It has also crippled all of mankind, totally upending our way of life and our plans for the future. All of the amazing progress in medicine and technology is not a match for this microscopic coronavirus.</p>
<p>The obvious lesson is that Hashem, not mankind, controls the world. This should suffice to eliminate hubris from everyone. By lowering ourselves and by ceasing <i>lashon hara</i> and <i>machlokes</i> we can do our share to end this horrific plague. By heeding Hashem's call, as the Rambam and Chafetz Chaim warn, with heartfelt <i>tefila</i> and <i>teshuva</i>, may we soon be taken by Hashem, as in Nissan long ago, from sadness to happiness, from mourning to celebration, and from heavy darkness to great light.</p>
