<P>Jews are often stereotyped as a hopelessly unsatisfied people
who can be difficult to please. If there is sociological evidence to warrant
and support this portrayal it is rooted not in a sophisticated palate or sensitive
disposition but rather in an underlying and intractable spiritual restlessness.
According to the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 76b) the parchedness mentioned in the
<i>pasuk</i>, "that the quenched shall be added to the <u>thirsty</u>"
(<i>Devarim</i> 29:18), refers to the Jewish people, who Rashi tells us "are
eternally eager and hungry to fear their Creator and fulfill His <i>mitzvos</i>".
Rav Shimshon Pincus (<i>Tiferes</i> <i>Shimshon</i>) concludes from this identification
that a Jew should be driven by a relentless thirst and craving to come closer to
Hashem such that it prevents him from ever being satiated or truly at peace
with the status quo. For this reason, in certain circles, pious Jews are approvingly
referred to as "<i>chareidim</i>" - "those who are anxious,"
because their religious observance is defined by a controlled and reasoned but at
the same time eager and anxious ambition for greater and more intense degrees
of spirituality.</p>

<P>In this sense, an appropriate dose of religious uneasiness
is a healthy sign and a reason to be optimistic about the overall spiritual
trajectory and possibility for future growth. This message surfaces from the reconciliation
of the different themes of Rosh Hashanah which at first glance seem to be
inconsistent. On the one hand, the sense of trepidation inherent in being
judged precludes the recitation of <i>hallel</i>, as the Gemara (<i>Rosh</i> <i>Hashanah</i>
32b) asks rhetorically, "is it possible that while the King is sitting on
the throne of judgment and the books of life and the books of death are open
before Him, the Jewish people should sing joyous songs?" At the same
time, the Tur (Sec. 581) rules that it is appropriate to eat, drink, and
rejoice on the day of Rosh Hashanah for the Jewish people are confident that
Hashem will vindicate them in judgment. How can one be apprehensive while
simultaneously unwaveringly secure? Perhaps one emotion yields the other. If the
fear of judgement is internalized, and worry over the verdict generates an
earnest pursuit of improvement, then there is ample reason to feel assured
about the prospects for the coming year.</p>

<P>An animated religious approach demands that there be some disruption
to the serenity of complacency. The Beis Yaakov of Izhbitza (<i>Parshas</i> <i>Noach</i>)
writes that a drunk is prohibited from praying (<i>Brochos</i> 31a) not only
because of his lost inhibitions and slurred speech, but rather because he is
numb to the tensions of life and devoid of inner conflict, as the Gemara (<i>Yoma</i>
75a) observes, "whoever casts his eye on his cup the whole world seems to
him like level ground." Prayer, and indeed all religious growth, is a
response to some measure of personal turmoil. Alcohol can induce an oblivious state
of ignorant bliss which is empty of any sense of striving or yearning to discover
transcendence and therefore incompatible with prayer. Similarly, Chazal (<i>Chagigah</i>
13a) comment that the design of the Chariot may only be transmitted to one whose
"heart inside him is concerned." Rav Tzadok Hakohen of Lublin (<i>Pri</i>
<i>Tzaddik</i>, <i>Beshalach</i>) explains that only when there is a sense of confusion
can a deeper understanding be found. It is precisely the troubled quest for
answers that serves as the impetus for greater knowledge and intimacy.</p>

<P>This outlook is the basis for the statement which the Mitteler
Rebbe attributes to the Maggid of Mezritch (<i>Kuntres HaHispaalus</i>, 5) that
"a man cannot possibly receive the true secrets of the Torah and the
deepest comprehension of the light of the <i>Ein Sof</i> unless he possesses a
natural essential melancholy." Certainly, the Maggid is not endorsing or
encouraging a depressed state, for Rav Chaim Vital (<i>Shaarei</i> <i>Kedushah</i>
2, 4) and later the Baal Shem Tov (<i>Tzavaas Harivash</i>) emphasize that sadness
and dejection are the primary tools of the <i>yetzer hara</i> and have no place
whatsoever in authentic and productive <i>avodas Hashem</i>. Elaborating on
their words, Rebbe Nachman of Breslov (Likutei Moharan 282) made famous the
notion that "a person must find some good point within himself and take
care to be happy always and keep away from depression." It is more likely
that the Maggid was referring to an inner discomfort, prompted by a voracious
appetite to ascend, that creates a brokenness through which the light of the <i>Ein
Sof</i> can enter. As opposed to the tranquil soul, who is not searching or
seeking, and therefore happy, content, and closed.</p>

<P>Perhaps, this awkward and unsettled spiritual state, which is
the trigger for further exploration and enrichment, began at Har Sinai. From
the dawn of the Jewish people, they have been distinguished by three hallmark
traits, as the Gemara (<i>Yevamos</i> 79a) states, "There are three qualities
of the Jewish people. They are merciful, they are shamefaced, and they perform
acts of kindness." The Baal Shem Tov (<i>Mekor Mayim Chaim</i>, <i>Parshas</i>
<i>Shemos</i>) claims that these three attributes can be traced back to the period
of the <i>avos</i>; kindness to Avraham, shamefacedness to Yitzchak, and
mercifulness to Yaakov. However, elsewhere we are told that the characteristic of
being shamefaced developed as a result of the revelation at Har Sinai, about
which the <i>pasuk</i> states "that His fear may be upon your faces"
(<i>Shemos</i> 20:17). The Gemara (<i>Nedarim</i> 20a) comments, "this is
referring to shame, one who does not have the capacity to be shamefaced, it is
known that his forefathers did not stand at Har Sinai." Did the tradition
of shamefacedness begin with the <i>avos</i> or was it only acquired later
after Har Sinai?</p>

<P>The Beis Yaakov of Izhbitza (<i>Parshas</i> <i>Yisro</i>)
resolves that there are two distinct sources and modes of shamefacedness. The
earliest form, and the one that is innate to the Jewish people, comes as a
response to sin. Since the time of Yitzchak, Jews have embodied the strength of
character to acknowledge failure and embrace an honest moment of embarrassment,
instead of retreating behind the embankment of indifferent disregard or brazen
obstinance. However, in the wake of Har Sinai, when the pinnacle of
spirituality became visible and the potential for Divine attachment was
unleashed, a second kind of shamefacedness emerged. This genre of embarrassment
is not a reaction to a specific incident but a pesty nagging sense of shame
that arises from the frustrated reality of unrealized potential. Har Sinai
changed the Jewish people's expectations for themselves and cast a shadow
of disappointment over their regular existence. Attempts to recreate and recapture
that experience invariably produces a holy anxiety which is a function of the confident
conviction that greater spiritual engagement is always possible.</p>

<P>There are some <i>mechanchim</i> today who are uncomfortable
using the word "potential" in their <i>yeshivos</i>. If their
hesitation is solely intended to underscore that each <i>talmid</i> is valued
and cherished for who they are presently, and not only for who they have the
potential to become, their initiative is valid and laudable. But the nature and
formulation of their opposition suggests another element as well. It seems that
they consider even mentioning the word "potential" in connection
with a <i>talmid</i> to be a disheartening insult because it implicitly
connotes an incomplete work in progress. While in years past, <i>talmidim</i>
were inspired by the bold belief that they have the "potential" for
<i>gadlus</i>, today, <i>talmidim</i> are coddled and reassured that they are already
big <i>tzaddikim</i>, from their head to their toe. However, this philosophy
which obfuscates the need and nobility to maximize potential, while perhaps
warranted in limited circumstances, should not be adopted broadly, because it extinguishes
any motivation to develop and achieve. Instead, we should stress that spiritual
growth is spurred specifically by recognizing the delta between who we are and
who we want to become and that genuine greatness resides in the ambitious struggle
to bridge the gap between them.</p>
