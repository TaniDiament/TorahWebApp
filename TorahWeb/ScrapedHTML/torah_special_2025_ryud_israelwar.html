<p>I believe that everyone remembers their excitement and relief upon hearing
the news immediately after <i>havdalah</i> on <i>motzaei</i> Shabbos <i>Parshas
Shlach</i>, when we learned of the United States' involvement in the
Israel-Iran conflict. The immediate response was &#8220;Baruch Hashem&#8221; - thank
You, Hashem, for Your intervention. Right after that, I recalled the <i>Gemara</i>
(<i>Brachos</i> 35b) which says that it is an added blessing &#8220;when your
work is done for you by others.&#8221; Those with a more attuned halachic mind
even recited the <i>beracha</i> upon hearing good news - <i>Hatov v&#8217;Hametiv</i>,
that He is good and bestows goodness on others. The only debate was whether the
blessing should be said with Hashem&#8217;s name or not. But all agreed - it
was a moment of thanksgiving. Thank You, Hashem.</p>

<p>This concept is taught in <i>Gittin</i> (38a), where Rav Pappa says,
&#8220;Ammon and Moav were purified by Sichon.&#8221; Hashem forbade (<i>Devarim</i>
2:9-19) the Jewish people from attacking or conquering the land of Ammon and
Moav, since they were our cousins, descended from Lot, Avraham&#8217;s nephew.
Yet shortly thereafter, when Bnei Yisrael asked to pass through the land of
Sichon and Og, not only were they denied, but they were attacked, and Bnei
Yisrael defeated them. Since Sichon and Og had previously conquered the
territory of Ammon and Moav, our defeat of them enabled us to live on that
land. Thus, Rav Pappa teaches that our work was done for us by others.</p>

<p>We see this idea in our liturgy. Every <i>amidah</i> begins with the
blessing of <i>Avos</i>, in which we praise Hashem as <i>Gomel chasadim tovim</i>
- He who bestows good kindnesses. Isn&#8217;t every kindness good? The
Lubavitcher Rebbe <i>zt&#8221;l</i> explained that Hashem not only helps us get
the job done, but His kindness is <i>tov</i> &#8211; good - in that He allows
us to feel as though <i>we</i> accomplished it, even though it is really done
through His help. It is truly our work being done by Others.</p>

<p>Similarly, in <i>Tehillim</i> (62:13), the verse says: &#8220;And Yours, O
Lord, is kindness, for You repay each man according to his deeds.&#8221; The
Alter of Kelm <i>zt&#8221;l</i> interpreted this to mean that Hashem rewards us
based on our deeds, even though any good we achieve is only possible through
His assistance.</p>

<p>There is no question that we are living in special times. Prime Minister
Netanyahu expressed this sentiment when he thanked the United States for their
assistance and concluded by acknowledging that it could not have happened
without <i>Siyata D&#8217;Shmaya</i> - Divine assistance. Sometimes we
don&#8217;t recognize Hashem&#8217;s involvement in world events until later;
other times, like now, it is immediately clear.</p>

<p>How should we respond?</p>

<p>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Shabbos</i> 33b) tells us that after R&#8217; Shimon
<i>bar</i> Yochai emerged from hiding in the cave, having been saved from the
Romans, he said, &#8220;Since a miracle was performed for me, I will go and
remedy something for the community.&#8221; We owe Hashem a response. The <i>Gemara</i>
discusses two or three different actions he took to benefit others after his
salvation. We, too, have witnessed a miracle - perhaps not over twelve years,
but over twelve days, truly a Divine wink. How should we respond?</p>

<p><i>Pirkei Avos</i> (5:22) teaches, in the words of Ben Bag Bag,
&#8220;Delve into the Torah and continue to delve into it, for everything is in
it.&#8221; And indeed, the <i>Gemara</i> in <i>Shabbos</i> tells us that when
the Torah says (<i>Bereishis</i> 33:18), &#8220;And Yaakov arrived
intact,&#8221; it means that he was whole in body, in wealth, and in Torah. The
verse continues, &#8220;and he encamped before the city,&#8221; which the
Rabbis understand to mean that he contributed to the welfare of the community
of Shechem. This ties into another teaching in <i>Shabbos</i> (32a), that
when someone experiences a miracle, they may lose some of their merit as
payment. Yaakov shows us that we must give back - responding to miracles with
acts of kindness and public service.</p>

<p>We see this again in <i>Shemos</i> (17:11), &#8220;When Moshe raised his
hands, Israel was stronger; when he lowered them, Amalek was stronger.&#8221;
The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a) asks: Did Moshe&#8217;s hands
win the battle? No - the verse teaches that when the Jewish people looked
upward and focused their hearts on their Father in Heaven, they prevailed.
Unlike standard military strategies that require watching the enemy, here
success came from looking upward - acknowledging that Hashem is, as the <i>Shira</i>
says (<i>Shemos</i> 15:3), the true Master of war.</p>

<p>We are living in extraordinary times. Just as in the Six-Day War, we were
again privileged to see miraculous military success - the destruction of the
Iranian air force in half an hour, in the middle of the night. This stands in
contrast to most of Jewish history, when we were pursued by our enemies. Now,
we are taking the initiative.</p>

<p>Think about it: what do we want from Iran? Do we want their land? Do we wish
to annex them? No. And yet, they seek to destroy us. Iran&#8217;s animosity is
irrational. As <i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> (55) states: &#8220;Both love and
hatred break the bounds of protocol.&#8221; I&#8217;m not a prophet, nor the
son of a prophet, but I believe that when we experience such clear Divine
intervention, we must respond with equally elevated behavior.</p>

<p>How can additional <i>gemilus chasadim</i> and <i>talmud Torah</i> not
only prevent any reduction in our merits but actually generate more Divine
blessings? <i>Chazal</i> teach that <i>mitzvos</i> help in the moment, but
Torah study sustains for the future.</p>

<p>The Gemara (<i>Megillah</i> 13a) tells us that Achashverosh&#8217;s
handing his ring to Haman did more to unify the Jewish people than all the rebuking
of the Prophets. It spurred real change and repentance. May this difficult and
inspiring time do the same - bring us together and strengthen our commitment to
Torah and acts of kindness. Repairing a relationship, apologizing even when
you&#8217;re right, or learning one extra <i>Mishnah</i> a day - all of these
are tangible responses.</p>

<p>As King David says (<i>Tehillim</i> 122:2), &#8220;Our feet stood firm
within your gates, O Jerusalem,&#8221; which the Gemara (<i>Makkos</i> 10a)
interprets to mean that our military strength comes from Torah study in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>May we continue to <i>daven</i> and act for the safety of the hostages, our
soldiers, and all of <i>Klal</i> Yisrael, and may we continue to hear <i>besuros
tovos, yeshuos, v&#8217;nechamos</i>.</p>
