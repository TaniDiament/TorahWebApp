<p align=center style='text-align:center'>I</p>

<P>&#8220;If you listen to my <i>mitzvos</i>, to love Hashem with
all your heart and all your soul, I will provide rain for your land and you
will gather your grain, your wine and your oil.&#8221; (<i>Devarim</i> 11:13-14,
the second <i>parsha</i> of <i>Shema</i>).</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Berachos</i>
35b) records a dispute between R&#8217; Yishmael, who rules that one must work
(<i>derech eretz</i>) to gather grain or otherwise earn a living, and R&#8217;
Shimon <i>ben</i> Yochai (Rashbi) who advocates that one&#8217;s work be done
by others. Rashbi explains that when Yisrael does not do the will of Hashem,
their work is done by themselves, as it says &#8220;You will gather your
grain.&#8221;</p>

<P>Tosfos ask, if one observes <i>mitzvos</i>
and loves Hashem with all his heart and soul, how can Rashbi call him one who
does not do the will of Hashem? They answer cryptically: they do His will, but
not totally, as they are not totally righteous (<i>tzadikim gemurim</i>).</p>

<P>The <i>Gemara</i> concludes: many
did like R&#8217; Yishmael and succeeded; like Rashbi and did not succeed.
Accordingly, the Shulchan Aruch (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 156:1) states
unequivocally: after davening, learning and eating (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 155), he
must go to work (<i>yelech la&#8217;asakov</i>). Moreover, as per <i>Avos</i>
(2:2) &#8220;All Torah study that has no work with it will end, and lead to
sin,&#8221; presumably to dishonesty to support his family. </p>

<P>Nonetheless, as the <i>Gemara</i>
(35b) states, Torah study should be primary (<i>ikar</i>) and work secondary (<i>arai</i>),
so that both will last.</p>

<P>The Maharsha expands on Tosfos&#8217;
cryptic answer. In the first parsha of Shema it says, &#8220;with all your resources
(<i>me&#8217;odecha</i>)&#8221; (6:5). The second parsha omits &#8220;<i>me&#8217;odchem</i>&#8221;,
implying that money is more beloved than bodily wellbeing (6:6). The punishment
is therefore monetary, that their work is not done by others.</p>

<P>The Tanchuma (<i>Noach</i> 3)
adds that one who loves wealth and pleasure cannot [properly] learn the Oral
Torah, which requires pain and sleeplessness. The way of Torah is to eat bread,
drink water, sleep on the ground, live a life of deprivation, and toil in Torah
(see <i>Avos</i> 6:4).</p>

<P>Am Yisrael said &#8220;we will do
and obey&#8221; (<i>Shemos</i> 24:7) the written Torah which is small and does
not require toil and pain. Later, they stood at the foot of the mountain (19:7)
and Hashem said &#8220;if you accept the Torah fine, if not you will be buried
there.&#8221; This refers to the Oral Torah, which is difficult, as strong as
death (see <i>Shir Hashirim</i> 8:6).</p>

<P>The love of Hashem with all your
recourses (6:5) is achieved when Torah is upon your heart (6:6). This is
Talmud, which requires sharp learning (6:7, see Rashi). There is no earthly
reward in the first parsha, as the reward is in the next world. The second
parsha has the earthly reward for those who perform mitzvos who do not
preoccupy themselves with Talmud.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>II</p>

<P>The <i>Biur Halacha</i> (156:1)
limits the ruling of the <i>Shulchun Aruch</i>, to &#8220;go to work&#8221;, to
the general public, that cannot reach the exalted level of preoccupation with
Torah study. The statement that many followed Rashbi and did not succeed
implies that a few can succeed . His proof is from the Rambam (<i>Hilchos Shemita
Veyoveil</i> 13:13) that one who ignores worldly pursuits that occupy most
people, and subsists in this world on his bare needs, is the holiest, whose
portion is Hashem forever, i.e. in the next world. This corresponds to the
Tanchuma&#8217;s description of the first parsha of Shema, and Tosfos&#8217;
and the Maharsha&#8217;s understanding of complete <i>tzadikim</i> who do the
will of Hashem totally.</p>

<P>Traditionally, only very few
individuals qualified to be part of this elite group. However, recently,
learning in <i>kollel</i> after marriage has seen exponential growth. Until
World War II it was virtually nonexistent in America, and counted very, very
few in Europe and Israel.</p>

<P>Harav Yehoshua Eichenstein, <i>shlit&#8221;a</i>
is the <i>Rosh Hayeshiva</i> of Yad Aharon in Yerushalayim. He is the son of
the former Chief Rabbi of St. Louis, Harav Menachem Eichenstein, and the
son-in-law of the former Chief Rabbi of Yerushalayim, Harav Betzalel Zolty. He
attributed this phenomenon to a ruling of the Chazon Ish. As a corrective to
the destruction of the world of Torah in the holocaust, learning in <i>kollel</i>
should become de rigeur for <i>Charedim</i>, and no longer for the spiritual
elite only.</p>

<P>Harav Eichenstein said that this
is only a temporary ruling (<i>hora&#8217;as sha&#8217;a</i>), as anyone who
has a brain in his head (<i>mo&#8217;ach b&#8217;kodkado</i>) realizes. When
this period ends should be determined by the <i>gedolei hador</i>, the Torah
leaders of the generation.</p>

<P>This seemingly obvious comment
generated tremendous controversy (see, and listen to <i>Tzarich Iyun</i>, 15
Iyar 5785). The real issue is how many qualify for the description of the
Tanchuma and the Rambam, whose choice to learn in <i>kollel</i> indefinitely is
legitimate.</p>

<P>Sadly, however, this issue has
been obfuscated by external considerations in <i>Eretz</i> Yisrael. Army
service, specifically, and adherence to hierarchal <i>Charedi</i> hegemony
generally, skews the discussion and silences dissenting legitimate views.</p>

<P>In America, where the mandate of
teaching one&#8217;s son an easy and clean profession (<i>Kiddushin</i> 82a) is
tied to higher secular education, opposition to &#8220;going to work&#8221; is increased
by this external consideration. The fear of negative influence in the Israeli
army parallels the fear of negative influence of a college education.</p>

<P>The exponential increase in draft
deferments based on <i>toraso umanoso</i>, Torah is his exclusive occupation,
from four hundred in 1948 to almost 70,000 today, is reflected in an equally
remarkable explosion in America. In the flagship <i>kollel</i> of the USA, Beis
Medrash Govoha of Lakewood, founded in 1942 by Harav Aharon Kotler with a few
members, it numbered under 200 when he passed away in 1962. Now BMG has about 7,000
thousand in its <i>kollel</i>, is joined by other <i>kollelim</i> in Lakewood
and beyond, and spawned a nationwide movement of <i>kollelim</i>.</p>

<P>All of this is a clear departure
from pre-World-War II Charedi Jewry. One hopes that all those supported by
communal funds, an innovation based in part on exigency to prevent Torah from
being forgotten (Rambam <i>Hilchos</i> <i>Talmud Torah</i> 3:10 and Kesef Mishna
at the end) are worthy recipients. One wonders if Harav Eichenstein&#8217;s
opinion, that this is an obviously a temporary correction, is accepted, even if
left unarticulated publicly, both here and in <i>Eretz</i> Yisrael.</p>

<p align=center style='text-align:center'>III</p>

<P>Any dispute that is for the sake
of Heaven will survive, such as the dispute between Hillel and Shammai (<i>Avos</i>
5:20, this week&#8217;s <i>perek</i>). Their disputes survived through their
respective disciples, Bais Hillel and Bais Shammai. The <i>Gemara</i> (<i>Yevamos</i>
14b) relates that they argued about issues of the greatest magnitude, including
illegitimate children (<i>mamzeirim</i>). Nonetheless, they intermarried when
possible. Moreover, they were friendly and affectionate to each other, in
fulfillment of &#8220;love truth and peace&#8221; (<i>Zecharia</i> 8:19). They
argued which position was true, but remained at peace with each other. This
practice will turn our days of mourning into days of joy (ibid), by eliminating
the basic hatred that caused the <i>churban</i>.</p>

<P>Often, as in the dispute
concerning &#8220;going to work&#8221; and army service, halachic arguments
center on contemporary scholars&#8217; interpretation of rulings by universally
accepted <i>gedolim</i> of recent generations. Sadly, here too the specific
issue can be obfuscated by external considerations. These can be ideological,
personal, or financial, and can result in a dispute that is not totally for the
sake of Heaven. Instead of the appropriate affection and friendship of those
who argue only for the sake of Heaven, as Bais Shammai and Bais Hillel, there
can be <i>ad hominem</i> public attacks by rabbis on other rabbis. This
furthers neither truth nor peace, and only postpones the <i>geula</i>.</p>

<P>There are real issues, both about
&#8220;going to work&#8221; and strict halacha, which need to be addressed
dispassionately and peacefully by Torah leaders and scholars. The obfuscation
created by external considerations tends to prevent proper discussion of the
real issues, and can lead to despicable divisiveness in our community. Let us
hope that love of truth and peace will prevail and bring us the ultimate <i>geula</i>
speedily in our days.</p>
